<P><A NAME="1">[76:1] Is it not a fact that there was a time when the human being was nothing to be mentioned?
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[76:2] We created the human from a liquid mixture, from two parents, in order to test him. Thus, we made him a hearer and a seer.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[76:3] We showed him the two paths, then he is either appreciative, or unappreciative.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[76:4] We prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[76:5] As for the virtuous, they will drink from cups spiced with nectar.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[76:6] A spring that is reserved for GOD's servants; it will gush out as they will.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[76:7] They fulfill their pledges, and reverence a day that is extremely difficult.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[76:8] They donate their favorite food to the poor, the orphan, and the captive.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[76:9] "We feed you for the sake of GOD; we expect no reward from you, nor thanks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[76:10] "We fear from our Lord a day that is full of misery and trouble."
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[76:11] Consequently, GOD protects them from the evils of that day, and rewards them with joy and contentment.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[76:12] He rewards them for their steadfastness with Paradise, and silk.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[76:13] They relax therein on luxurious furnishings. They suffer neither the heat of the sun, nor any cold.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[76:14] The shade covers them therein, and the fruits are brought within reach.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[76:15] They are served drinks in silver containers and cups that are translucent.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[76:16] Translucent cups, though made of silver; they rightly deserved all this.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[76:17] They enjoy drinks of delicious flavors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[76:18] From a spring therein known as "Salsabeel."
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[76:19] Serving them will be immortal servants. When you see them, they will look like scattered pearls.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[76:20] Wherever you look, you will see bliss, and a wonderful dominion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[76:21] On them will be clothes of green velvet, satin, and silver ornaments. Their Lord will provide them with pure drinks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[76:22] This is the reward that awaits you, for your efforts have been appreciated.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[76:23] We have revealed to you this Quran; a special revelation from us.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[76:24] You shall steadfastly carry out your Lord's commandments, and do not obey any sinful disbeliever among them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[76:25] And commemorate the name of your Lord day and night.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[76:26] During the night, fall prostrate before Him, and glorify Him many a long night.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[76:27] These people are preoccupied with this fleeting life, while disregarding - just ahead of them - a heavy day.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[76:28] We created them, and established them, and, whenever we will, we can substitute others in their place.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[76:29] This is a reminder: whoever wills shall choose the path to his Lord.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[76:30] Whatever you will is in accordance with GOD's will.  GOD is Omniscient, Wise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[76:31] He admits whomever He wills into His mercy. As for the transgressors, He has prepared for them a painful retribution.
