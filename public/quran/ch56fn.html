<p class="footnote"><A NAME="13">*56:13-40 People who believe and nourish their souls through worshiping God alone are destined for the High Heaven. The contemporary followers of each messenger invariably suffer persecution from the traditionalists and adherents of the corrupted religion. Thus, they have a special place reserved for them in the High Heaven. All people who die before the age of 40 go to the Lower Heaven, at least (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#15">46:15</a>).</P>

<p class="footnote"><A NAME="76">*56:75-76 Our universe, the smallest and innermost of seven universes, contains a billion galaxies, a billion trillion stars, spanning billions of light years. These uncountable decillions of heavenly bodies maintain their orbits in a divinely controlled precision. The more we learn, the more we realize how awesome this oath is. See Appendix 6.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="79">*56:79 The insincere who are not satisfied with the Quran alone are divinely prevented from understanding the Quran. This concept is repeated throughout the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#45">17:45</a>-46, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#57">18:57</a>). Consequently, they cannot understand this verse. For example, compare this translation of <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch7.html#3">7:3</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#46">17:46</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch41.html#44">41:44</a>, and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch56.html#79">56:79</a> with other translations.</P>
