<p class="footnote"><A NAME="18">*27:18-19 The more unusual the events in a given sura, the stronger the mathematical evidence supporting them. This helps assure us that such strange phenomena are indicative of God's power. This sura's initials, T.S., constitute a complex part of the mathematical miracles related to the Quranic initials. The unusual birth and miracles of Jesus are in Sura 19, which is prefixed with five Quranic Initials. See Appendix 1 for the details.</P>

This restores the total occurrence of `Basmalah' to 114, 19x6. See Appendix 29 for details of a vast and profound miracle attached to this `Basmalah.'</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="82">*27:82 (2+7+8+2 = 19) The computer was required to unveil the Quran's mathematical miracle, and it proved that most people have discarded God's message (see Appendices 1 & 19).</P>
