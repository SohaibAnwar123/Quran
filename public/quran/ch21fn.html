<p class="footnote"><A NAME="3">*21:3 Although the Bible (Malachi 3:1) and the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a>) prophesy the advent of God's Messenger of the Covenant, when he did appear, supported by `one of the greatest miracles' (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#30">74:30</a>-35), he was met with heedlessness and opposition. The divine assertion that every `new' proof is opposed has been proven by the Arabs' opposition to the Quran's miracle. (App. 1 & 2).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="28">*21:28 The myth of intercession is Satan's most effective bait (see Appendix 8).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="30">*21:30 The Big Bang Theory is now supported by the Creator's infallible mathematical code (Appendix 1). Thus, it is no longer a theory; it is a law, a proven fact.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="51">*21:51 Was Abraham so smart as to discover God, or, did God grant him the intelligence because He knew that he deserved to be saved? As it turns out, this whole world was created to redeem those among us who deserve redemption. When the angels suggested that all the rebels, humans and jinns, must be banished out of God's kingdom, He said, `I know what you do not know' (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#30">2:30</a>). At the same time, this world proves Satan's incompetence as a god (App. 7).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="69">*21:69 "Cool," without "and safe" would have caused Abraham to freeze.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="73">*21:73 When the Quran was revealed, all religious duties were already established through Abraham (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#128">2:128</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#123">16:123</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#78">22:78</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="90">*21:90 The use of the plural tense throughout the Quran indicates participation of the angels. It is clear from <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#39">3:39</a> and from the Bible that the angels dealt with Zachariah extensively, as they gave him the good news about John. See Appendix 10.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="96">*21:96 By the year 2270 AD, thanks to God's mathematical miracle in the Quran (Appendix 1), America will be the heart of Islam, and billions around the globe will have believed in the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#33">9:33</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch41.html#53">41:53</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch48.html#28">48:28</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a>). Gog and Magog (allegorical names of villainous communities), will be the only bastions of heathenism, and they will attack the submitters. That is when the world will end (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch15.html#87">15:87</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#94">18:94</a>, Appendix 25). Gog and Magog are mentioned in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#94">18:94</a> & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch21.html#96">21:96</a>, 17 verses before the end of each sura; this may indicate the time of their appearance.</P>
