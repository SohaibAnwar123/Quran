</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[4:1] O people, observe your Lord; the One who created you from one being, and created from it its mate, then spread from the two many men and women. You shall regard GOD, by whom you swear, and regard the parents. GOD is watching over you.*

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard the Orphans</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="2">[4:2] You shall hand over to the orphans their rightful properties. Do not substitute the bad for the good, and do not consume their properties by combining them with yours. This would be a gross injustice.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds For Polygamy*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="3">[4:3] If you deem it best for the orphans, you may marry their mothers - you may marry two, three, or four. If you fear lest you become unfair, then you shall be content with only one, or with what you already have. Additionally, you are thus more likely to avoid financial hardship.

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch4fn.html#3">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[4:4] You shall give the women their due dowries, equitably. If they willingly forfeit anything, then you may accept it; it is rightfully yours.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[4:5] Do not give immature orphans the properties that GOD has entrusted with you as guardians. You shall provide for them therefrom, and clothe them, and treat them kindly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[4:6] You shall test the orphans when they reach puberty. As soon as you find them mature enough, give them their property. Do not consume it extravagantly in a hurry, before they grow up. The rich guardian shall not charge any wage, but the poor guardian may charge equitably. When you give them their properties, you shall have witnesses. GOD suffices as Reckoner.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's Inheritance Rights</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="7">[4:7] The men get a share of what the parents and the relatives leave behind. The women too shall get a share of what the parents and relatives leave behind. Whether it is a small or a large inheritance, (the women must get) a definite share.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[4:8] During distribution of the inheritances, if relatives, orphans, and needy persons are present, you shall give them therefrom, and treat them kindly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[4:9] Those who are concerned about their own children, in case they leave them behind, shall observe GOD and be equitable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[4:10] Those who consume the orphans' properties unjustly, eat fire into their bellies, and will suffer in Hell.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If No Will Is Left*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="11">[4:11] GOD decrees a will for the benefit of your children; the male gets twice the share of the female.* If the inheritors are only women, more than two, they get two-thirds of what is bequeathed. If only one daughter is left, she gets one-half. The parents of the deceased get one-sixth of the inheritance each, if the deceased has left any children. If he left no children, and his parents are the only inheritors, the mother gets one-third. If he has siblings, then the mother gets one-sixth. All this, after fulfilling any will* the deceased has left, and after paying off all debts. When it comes to your parents and your children, you do not know which of them is really the best to you and the most beneficial. This is GOD's law. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance For the Spouses</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="12">[4:12] You get half of what your wives leave behind, if they had no children. If they had children, you get one-fourth of what they leave. All this, after fulfilling any will they had left, and after paying off all debts. They get one-fourth of what you leave behind, if you had no children. If you had children, they get one-eighth of what you bequeath. All this, after fulfilling any will you had left, and after paying off all debts. If the deceased man or woman was a loner, and leaves two siblings, male or female, each of them gets one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are more siblings, then they equally share one-third of the inheritance. All this, after fulfilling any will, and after paying off all debts, so that no one is hurt. This is a will decreed by GOD. GOD is Omniscient, Clement.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Communicates With Us Through His Messenger</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="13">[4:13] These are GOD's laws. Those who obey GOD and His messenger, He will admit them into gardens with flowing streams, wherein they abide forever. This is the greatest triumph.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[4:14] As for the one who disobeys GOD and His messenger, and transgresses His laws, He will admit him into Hell, wherein he abides forever. He has incurred a shameful retribution.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Quarantine</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="15">[4:15] Those who commit adultery among your women, you must have four witnesses against them, from among you. If they do bear witness, then you shall keep such women in their homes until they die, or until GOD creates an exit for them.*

</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repentance</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="17">[4:17] Repentance is acceptable by GOD from those who fall in sin out of ignorance, then repent immediately thereafter. GOD redeems them. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[4:18] Not acceptable is the repentance of those who commit sins until death comes to them, then say, "Now I repent." Nor is it acceptable from those who die as disbelievers. For these, we have prepared a painful retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[4:19] O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit what the women leave behind, against their will. You shall not force them to give up anything you had given them, unless they commit a proven adultery. You shall treat them nicely. If you dislike them, you may dislike something wherein GOD has placed a lot of good.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection for Women</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="20">[4:20] If you wish to marry another wife, in place of your present wife, and you had given any of them a great deal, you shall not take back anything you had given her. Would you take it fraudulently, maliciously, and sinfully?
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[4:21] How could you take it back, after you have been intimate with each other, and they had taken from you a solemn pledge?
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect for the Father</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="22">[4:22] Do not marry the women who were previously married to your fathers - existing marriages are exempted and shall not be broken - for it is a gross offense, and an abominable act.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incest Forbidden</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="23">[4:23] Prohibited for you (in marriage) are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, the sisters of your fathers, the sisters of your mothers, the daughters of your brother, the daughters of your sister, your nursing mothers, the girls who nursed from the same woman as you, the mothers of your wives, the daughters of your wives with whom you have consummated the marriage - if the marriage has not been consummated, you may marry the daughter. Also prohibited for you are the women who were married to your genetic sons. Also, you shall not be married to two sisters at the same time - but do not break up existing marriages. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual Attraction And Dowry Required</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="24">[4:24] Also prohibited are the women who are already married, unless they flee their disbelieving husbands who are at war with you.* These are GOD's commandments to you. All other categories are permitted for you in marriage, so long as you pay them their due dowries. You shall maintain your morality, by not committing adultery. Thus, whoever you like among them, you shall pay them the dowry decreed for them. You commit no error by mutually agreeing to any adjustments to the dowry. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch4fn.html#24">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[4:25] Those among you who cannot afford to marry free believing women, may marry believing slave women. GOD knows best about your belief, and you are equal to one another, as far as belief is concerned. You shall obtain permission from their guardians before you marry them, and pay them their due dowry equitably. They shall maintain moral behavior, by not committing adultery, or having secret lovers. Once they are freed through marriage, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half of that for the free women.* Marrying a slave shall be a last resort for those unable to wait. To be patient is better for you. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.

</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[4:26] GOD wills to explain things for you, and to guide you through past precedents, and to redeem you. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Mercy</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="27">[4:27] GOD wishes to redeem you, while those who pursue their lusts wish that you deviate a great deviation.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[4:28] GOD wishes to lighten your burden, for the human being is created weak.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murder, Suicide, and Illicit Gains Prohibited</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="29">[4:29] O you who believe, do not consume each others' properties illicitly - only mutually acceptable transactions are permitted. You shall not kill yourselves. GOD is Merciful towards you.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[4:30] Anyone who commits these transgressions, maliciously and deliberately, we will condemn him to Hell. This is easy for GOD to do.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[4:31] If you refrain from committing the gross sins that are prohibited for you, we will remit your sins, and admit you an honorable admittance.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and Women Endowed With Unique Qualities</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="32">[4:32] You shall not covet the qualities bestowed upon each other by GOD; the men enjoy certain qualities, and the women enjoy certain qualities. You may implore GOD to shower you with His grace. GOD is fully aware of all things.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do Not Object to the Inheritance Laws Proposed by God</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="33">[4:33] For each of you, we have designated shares from the inheritance left by the parents and the relatives. Also those related to you through marriage, you shall give them their due share. GOD witnesses all things.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do Not Beat Your Wife*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="34">[4:34] The men are made responsible for the women,** and GOD has endowed them with certain qualities, and made them the bread earners. The righteous women will cheerfully accept this arrangement, since it is GOD's commandment, and honor their husbands during their absence. If you experience rebellion from the women, you shall first talk to them, then (you may use negative incentives like) deserting them in bed, then you may (as a last alternative) beat them. If they obey you, you are not permitted to transgress against them. GOD is Most High, Supreme.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage Arbitration</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="35">[4:35] If a couple fears separation, you shall appoint an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family; if they decide to reconcile, GOD will help them get together. GOD is Omniscient, Cognizant.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major Commandments</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="36">[4:36] You shall worship GOD alone - do not associate anything with Him. You shall regard the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, the related neighbor, the unrelated neighbor, the close associate, the traveling alien, and your servants. GOD does not like the arrogant show-offs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[4:37] The ones who are stingy, exhort the people to be stingy, and conceal what GOD has bestowed upon them from His bounties. We have prepared for the disbelievers a shameful retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[4:38] They give money to charity only to show off, while disbelieving in GOD and the Last Day. If one's companion is the devil, that is the worst companion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[4:39] Why do they not believe in GOD and the Last Day, and give from GOD's provisions to them? GOD is fully aware of them.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine Justice</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="40">[4:40] GOD does not inflict an atom's weight of injustice. On the contrary, He multiplies the reward manifold for the righteous work, and grants from Him a great recompense.
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[4:41] Thus, when the day (of judgment) comes, we will call upon a witness from each community, and you (the messenger) will serve as a witness among these people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[4:42] On that day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground; not a single utterance will they be able to hide from GOD.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Nullifies Ablution</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="43">[4:43] O you who believe, do not observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) while intoxicated, so that you know what you are saying. Nor after sexual orgasm without bathing, unless you are on the road, traveling; if you are ill or traveling, or you had urinary or fecal-related excretion (such as gas), or contacted the women (sexually), and you cannot find water, you shall observe Tayammum (dry ablution) by touching clean dry soil, then wiping your faces and hands therewith. GOD is Pardoner, Forgiver.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[4:44] Have you noted those who received a portion of the scripture, and how they choose to stray, and wish that you stray from the path?
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[4:45] GOD knows best who your enemies are. GOD is the only Lord and Master. GOD is the only Supporter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[4:46] Among those who are Jewish, some distort the words beyond the truth, and they say, "We hear, but we disobey," and "Your words are falling on deaf ears," and "Raa'ena* (be our shepherd)," as they twist their tongues to mock the religion. Had they said, "We hear, and we obey," and "We hear you," and "Unzurna (watch over us)," it would have been better for them, and more righteous. Instead, they have incurred condemnation from GOD due to their disbelief. Consequently, the majority of them cannot believe.
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch4fn.html#46">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[4:47] O you who received the scripture, you shall believe in what we reveal herein, confirming what you have, before we banish certain faces to exile, or condemn them as we condemned those who desecrated the Sabbath. GOD's command is done.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unforgivable Sin</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="48">[4:48] GOD does not forgive idolatry,* but He forgives lesser offenses for whomever He wills. Anyone who sets up idols beside GOD, has forged a horrendous offense.
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch4fn.html#48">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[4:49] Have you noted those who exalt themselves? Instead, GOD is the One who exalts whomever He wills, without the least injustice.
</P>
<P><A NAME="50">[4:50] Note how they fabricate lies about GOD; what a gross offense this is!
</P>
<P><A NAME="51">[4:51] Have you noted those who received a portion of the scripture, and how they believe in idolatry and false doctrine, then say, "The disbelievers are better guided than the believers?!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[4:52] It is they who incurred GOD's condemnation, and whomever GOD condemns, you will not find any helper for him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="53">[4:53] Do they own a share of the sovereignty? If they did, they would not give the people as much as a grain.
</P>
<P><A NAME="54">[4:54] Are they envious of the people because GOD has showered them with His blessings? We have given Abraham's family the scripture, and wisdom; we granted them a great authority.
</P>
<P><A NAME="55">[4:55] Some of them believed therein, and some of them repelled therefrom; Hell is the only just retribution for these.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegorical Description of Hell</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="56">[4:56] Surely, those who disbelieve in our revelations, we will condemn them to the hellfire. Whenever their skins are burnt, we will give them new skins. Thus, they will suffer continuously. GOD is Almighty, Most Wise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="57">[4:57] As for those who believe and lead a righteous life, we will admit them into gardens with flowing streams; they abide therein forever. They will have pure spouses therein. We will admit them into a blissful shade.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honesty & Justice Advocated</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="58">[4:58] GOD commands you to give back anything the people have entrusted to  you. If you judge among the people, you shall judge equitably. The best enlightenment indeed is what GOD recommends for you. GOD is Hearer, Seer.
</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[4:59] O you who believe, you shall obey GOD, and you shall obey the messenger, and those in charge among you. If you dispute in any matter, you shall refer it to GOD and the messenger, if you do believe in GOD and the Last Day. This is better for you, and provides you with the best solution.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers  Or  Hypocrites?</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="60">[4:60] Have you noted those who claim that they believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, then uphold the unjust laws of their idols? They were commanded to reject such laws. Indeed, it is the devil's wish to lead them far astray.
</P>
<P><A NAME="61">[4:61] When they are told, "Come to what GOD has revealed, and to the messenger," you see the hypocrites shunning you completely.
</P>
<P><A NAME="62">[4:62] How will it be when a disaster hits them, as a consequence of their own works? They will come to you then and swear by GOD: "Our intentions were good and righteous!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[4:63] GOD is fully aware of their innermost intentions. You shall ignore them, enlighten them, and give them good advice that may save their souls.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unquestioning Submission: Quality of the True Believers</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="64">[4:64] We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed in accordance with GOD's will. Had they, when they wronged their souls, come to you and prayed to GOD for forgiveness, and the messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found GOD Redeemer, Most Merciful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[4:65] Never indeed, by your Lord; they are not believers unless they come to you to judge in their disputes, then find no hesitation in their hearts whatsoever in accepting your judgment. They must submit a total submission.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Tests Are Never Unreasonable</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="66">[4:66] Had we decreed for them: "You must offer your lives," or "Give up your homes," they would not have done it, except for a few of them. (Even if such a command was issued,) had they done what they were commanded to do, it would have been better for them, and would prove the strength of their faith.
</P>
<P><A NAME="67">[4:67] And we would have granted them a great recompense.
</P>
<P><A NAME="68">[4:68] And we would have guided them in the right path.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equality of Believers</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="69">[4:69] Those who obey GOD and the messenger belong with those blessed by GOD - the prophets, the saints, the martyrs, and the righteous. These are the best company.
</P>
<P><A NAME="70">[4:70] Such is the blessing from GOD; GOD is the best Knower.
</P>
<P><A NAME="71">[4:71] O you who believe, you shall remain alert, and mobilize as individuals, or mobilize all together.
</P>
<P><A NAME="72">[4:72] Surely, there are those among you who would drag their feet, then, if a setback afflicts you, they would say, "GOD has blessed me that I was not martyred with them."
</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[4:73] But if you attain a blessing from GOD, they would say, as if no friendship ever existed between you and them, "I wish I was with them, so I could share in such a great victory."
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[4:74] Those who readily fight in the cause of GOD are those who forsake this world in favor of the Hereafter. Whoever fights in the cause of GOD, then gets killed, or attains victory, we will surely grant him a great recompense.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Believers are Fearless</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="75">[4:75] Why should you not fight in the cause of GOD when weak men, women, and children are imploring: "Our Lord, deliver us from this community whose people are oppressive, and be You our Lord and Master."
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[4:76] Those who believe are fighting for the cause of GOD, while those who disbelieve are fighting for the cause of tyranny. Therefore, you shall fight the devil's allies; the devil's power is nil.
</P>
<P><A NAME="77">[4:77] Have you noted those who were told, "You do not have to fight; all you need to do is observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat)," then, when fighting was decreed for them, they feared the people as much as they feared GOD, or even more? They said, "Our Lord, why did You force this fighting on us? If only You respite us for awhile!" Say, "The materials of this world are nil, while the Hereafter is far better for the righteous, and you never suffer the slightest injustice."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is the Doer of Everything*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="78">[4:78] Wherever you are, death will catch up with you, even if you live in formidable castles. When something good happens to them, they say, "This is from GOD," and when something bad afflicts them, they blame you. Say, "Everything comes from GOD." Why do these people misunderstand almost everything?

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="79">[4:79] Anything good that happens to you is from GOD, and anything bad that happens to you is from you. We have sent you as a messenger to the people,* and GOD suffices as witness.

<P><A NAME="80">[4:80] Whoever obeys the messenger is obeying GOD. As for those who turn away, we did not send you as their guardian.
</P>
<P><A NAME="81">[4:81] They pledge obedience, but as soon as they leave you, some of them harbor intentions contrary to what they say. GOD records their innermost intentions. You shall disregard them, and put your trust in GOD. GOD suffices as an advocate.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of Divine Authorship</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="82">[4:82] Why do they not study the Quran carefully? If it were from other than GOD, they would have found in it numerous contradictions.*

</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of the Devil's Rumors</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="83">[4:83] When a rumor that affects security comes their way, they spread it. Had they referred it to the messenger, and those in charge among them, those who understand these matters would have informed them. If it were not for GOD's grace towards you, and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except a few.
</P>
<P><A NAME="84">[4:84] You shall fight for the cause of GOD; you are responsible only for your own soul, and exhort the believers to do the same. GOD will neutralize the power of those who disbelieve. GOD is much more powerful, and much more effective.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="85">[4:85] Whoever mediates a good deed receives a share of the credit thereof, and whoever mediates an evil work, incurs a share thereof. GOD controls all things.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You Shall Be Courteous</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="86">[4:86] When greeted with a greeting, you shall respond with a better greeting or at least an equal one. GOD reckons all things.
</P>
<P><A NAME="87">[4:87] GOD: there is no god except He. He will surely summon you on the Day of Resurrection - the inevitable day. Whose narration is more truthful than GOD's?
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Deal With the Hypocrites</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="88">[4:88] Why should you divide yourselves into two groups regarding hypocrites (among you)? GOD is the one who condemned them because of their own behavior. Do you want to guide those who are sent astray by GOD? Whomever GOD sends astray, you can never find a way to guide them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="89">[4:89] They wish that you disbelieve as they have disbelieved, then you become equal. Do not consider them friends, unless they mobilize along with you in the cause of GOD. If they turn against you, you shall fight them, and you may kill them when you encounter them in war. You shall not accept them as friends, or allies.*

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch4fn.html#89">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="90">[4:90] Exempted are those who join people with whom you have signed a peace treaty, and those who come to you wishing not to fight you, nor fight their relatives. Had GOD willed, He could have permitted them to fight against you. Therefore, if they leave you alone, refrain from fighting you, and offer you peace, then GOD gives you no excuse to fight them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="91">[4:91] You will find others who wish to make peace with you, and also with their people. However, as soon as war erupts, they fight against you. Unless these people leave you alone, offer you peace, and stop fighting you, you may fight them when you encounter them. Against these, we give you a clear authorization.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You Shall Not Kill</P>
