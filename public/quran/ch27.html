</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[27:3] Who observe the Contact Prayers (Salat), give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and they are, with regard to the Hereafter, absolutely certain.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[27:4] Those who do not believe in the Hereafter, we adorn their works in their eyes. Thus, they continue to blunder.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[27:5] It is these who incur the worst retribution, and in the Hereafter, they will be the worst losers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[27:6] Surely, you are receiving the Quran from a Most Wise, Omniscient.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="7">[27:7] Recall that Moses said to his family, "I see a fire; let me bring you news therefrom, or a torch to warm you."
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[27:8] When he came to it, he was called: "Blessed is the One (who is speaking from) within the fire, and those around it." Glory be to GOD, Lord of the universe.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[27:9] "O Moses, this is Me, GOD, the Almighty, Most Wise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[27:10] "Throw down your staff." When he saw it moving like a demon, he turned around and fled. "O Moses, do not be afraid. My messengers shall not fear.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[27:11] "Except those who commit a transgression, then substitute righteousness after sinning; I am Forgiving, Most Merciful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[27:12] "Put your hand in your pocket; it will come out white, without a blemish. These are among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his people, for they are wicked people."
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[27:13] When our miracles were presented to them, clear and profound, they said, "This is obviously magic."
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[27:14] They rejected them and were utterly convinced of their wrong ways, due to their arrogance. Note the consequences for the evildoers.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David and Solomon</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="15">[27:15] We endowed David and Solomon with knowledge, and they said, "Praise GOD for blessing us more than many of His believing servants."
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[27:16] Solomon was David's heir. He said, "O people, we have been endowed with understanding the language of the birds, and all kinds of things have been bestowed upon us. This is indeed a real blessing."
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[27:17] Mobilized in the service of Solomon were his obedient soldiers of jinns and humans, as well as the birds; all at his disposal.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[27:18] When they approached the valley of the ants, one ant said, "O you ants, go into your homes, lest you get crushed by Solomon and his soldiers, without perceiving."*

</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[27:19] He smiled and laughed at her statement,* and said, "My Lord, direct me to be appreciative of the blessings You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and to do the righteous works that please You. Admit me by Your mercy into the company of Your righteous servants."

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch27fn.html#19">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[27:20] He inspected the birds, and noted: "Why do I not see the hoopoe? Why is he missing?
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[27:21] "I will punish him severely or sacrifice him, unless he gives me a good excuse."
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[27:22] He did not wait for long. (The hoopoe) said, "I have news that you do not have. I brought to you from Sheba, some important information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[27:23] "I found a woman ruling them, who is blessed with everything, and possesses a tremendous palace.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[27:24] "I found her and her people prostrating before the sun, instead of GOD. The devil has adorned their works in their eyes, and has repulsed them from the path; consequently, they are not guided."
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[27:25] They should have been prostrating before GOD, the One who manifests all the mysteries in the heavens and the earth, and the One who knows everything you conceal and everything you declare.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[27:26] GOD: there is no other god beside Him; the Lord with the great dominion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[27:27] (Solomon) said, "We will see if you told the truth, or if you are a liar.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[27:28] "Take this letter from me, give it to them, then watch for their response."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in Sheba</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="29">[27:29] She said, "O my advisers, I have received an honorable letter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[27:30] "It is from Solomon, and it is, `In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.' *
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch27fn.html#30">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[27:31] "Proclaiming: `Do not be arrogant; come to me as submitters.' "
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[27:32] She said, "O my advisers, counsel me in this matter. I am not deciding anything until you advise me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[27:33] They said, "We possess the power, we possess the fighting skills, and the ultimate command is in your hand. You decide what to do."
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[27:34] She said, "The kings corrupt any land they invade, and subjugate its dignified people. This is what they usually do.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[27:35] "I am sending a gift to them; let us see what the messengers come back with."
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[27:36] When the hoopoe returned to Solomon (he told him the news), and he responded (to Sheba's people): "Are you giving me money? What GOD has given me is far better than what He has given you. You are the ones to rejoice in such gifts."
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[27:37] (To the hoopoe, he said,) "Go back to them (and let them know that) we will come to them with forces they cannot imagine. We will evict them, humiliated and debased."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faster Than the Speed of Light</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="38">[27:38] He said, "O you elders, which of you can bring me her mansion, before they arrive here as submitters?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[27:39] One afrit from the jinns said, "I can bring it to you before you stand up. I am powerful enough to do this."
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[27:40] The one who possessed knowledge from the book said, "I can bring it to you in the blink of your eye." When he saw it settled in front of him, he said, "This is a blessing from my Lord, whereby He tests me, to show whether I am appreciative or unappreciative. Whoever is appreciative is appreciative for his own good, and if one turns unappreciative, then my Lord is in no need for him, Most Honorable."
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[27:41] He said, "Remodel her mansion for her. Let us see if she will be guided, or continue with the misguided."
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[27:42] When she arrived, she was asked, "Does your mansion look like this?" She said, "It seems that this is it." (Solomon said,) "We knew beforehand what she was going to do, and we were already submitters."
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[27:43] She had been diverted by worshiping idols instead of GOD; she belonged to disbelieving people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[27:44] She was told, "Go inside the palace." When she saw its interior, she thought it was a pool of water, and she (pulled up her dress,) exposing her legs. He said, "This interior is now paved with crystal." She said, "My Lord, I have wronged my soul. I now submit with Solomon to GOD, Lord of the universe."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saaleh</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="45">[27:45] We have sent to Thamoud their brother Saaleh, saying, "You shall worship GOD." But they turned into two feuding factions.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[27:46] He said, "O my people, why do you hasten to commit evil instead of good works? If only you implore GOD for forgiveness, you may attain mercy."
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[27:47] They said, "We consider you a bad omen for us, you and those who joined you." He said, "Your omen is fully controlled by GOD. Indeed, you are deviant people."
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[27:48] There were nine gangsters in the city who were wicked, and never did anything good.
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[27:49] They said, "Let us swear by GOD that we kill him and his people, then tell his tribe, `We know nothing about their death. We are truthful.' "
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Protects The Believers</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="50">[27:50] They plotted and schemed, but we also plotted and schemed, while they did not perceive.
</P>
<P><A NAME="51">[27:51] Note the consequences of their plotting; we annihilated them and all their people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[27:52] Here are their homes utterly ruined, because of their transgression. This should be a lesson for people who know.
</P>
<P><A NAME="53">[27:53] We save those who believe and lead a righteous life.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="54">[27:54] Lot said to his people, "How could you commit such an abomination, publicly, while you see?
</P>
<P><A NAME="55">[27:55] "You practice sex with the men, lustfully, instead of the women. Indeed, you are ignorant people."
</P>
<P><A NAME="56">[27:56] The only response from his people was their saying, "Banish Lot's family from your town; they are people who wish to be pure."
</P>
<P><A NAME="57">[27:57] Consequently, we saved him and his family, except his wife; we counted her among the doomed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="58">[27:58] We showered them with a certain shower. It was a miserable shower upon people who had been warned.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make No Distinction Among God's Messengers</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="59">[27:59] Say, "Praise be to GOD and peace be upon His servants whom He chose. Is GOD better, or the idols some people set up?"
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God ALONE Worthy of Worship</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="60">[27:60] Who is the One who created the heavens and the earth? Who is the One who sends down to you from the sky water, whereby we produce gardens full of beauty - you could not possibly manufacture its trees? Is it another god with GOD? Indeed, they are people who have deviated.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="61">[27:61] Who is the One who made the earth habitable, caused rivers to run through it, placed on it mountains, and created a barrier between the two waters? Is it another god with GOD? Indeed, most of them do not know.

</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[27:63] Who is the One who guides you in the darkness of land and sea? Who is the One who sends the winds with good news, signaling His mercy? Is it another god with GOD? Most exalted is GOD, above having any partner.
</P>
<P><A NAME="64">[27:64] Who is the One who initiates the creation, then repeats it? Who is the One who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Is it another god with GOD? Say, "Show me your proof, if you are truthful."
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[27:65] Say, "No one in the heavens and the earth knows the future except GOD. They do not even perceive how or when they will be resurrected."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing in the Hereafter: Great Obstacle for Most People</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="66">[27:66] In fact, their knowledge concerning the Hereafter is confused. In fact, they harbor doubts about it. In fact, they are totally heedless thereof.

</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[27:73] Your Lord is full of grace towards the people, but most of them are unappreciative.
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[27:74] Your Lord fully knows what their chests hide, and what they declare.
</P>
<P><A NAME="75">[27:75] There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that is hidden (from God); everything is in a profound record.
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[27:76] This Quran settles many issues for the Children of Israel; issues that they are still disputing.
