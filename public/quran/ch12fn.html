<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*12:1 The Quranic initials constitute a major component of a great miracle (App. 1).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="2">*12:2 Why was the Quran revealed in Arabic? See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch41.html#44">41:44</a> and Appendix 4.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="9">*12:9 We learn from Joseph's dream that he was destined for a bright future. Thus, while his brothers met to decide his fate, his fate was already decided by God. Everything is done by God (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#17">8:17</a>), and is already recorded (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch57.html#22">57:22</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="23">*12:23 Joseph worded this statement in such a way that the governor's wife thought that he was talking about her husband, when in fact he was talking about God.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="31">*12:31 This is the same word used in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#38">5:38</a> regarding the hand of the thief, and the sum of sura and verse numbers (12+31 and 5+38) are the same. Therefore, the thief's hand should be marked, not severed as practiced by the corrupted Islam (see Footnote <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#38">5:38</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="42">*12:42 When Joseph begged his companion to intercede with the king on his behalf, he exhibited dependence on other than God to be saved from the prison. This does not befit a true believer, and such a serious slip cost Joseph a few years in the prison. We learn from the Quran that only God can relieve any hardship that might befall us. A true believer trusts in God and depends totally on Him alone (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch1.html#5">1:5</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#17">6:17</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#17">8:17</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch10.html#107">10:107</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="93">*12:93 This marks the beginning of the Children of Israel in Egypt. Moses led them out of Egypt a few centuries later.</P>
