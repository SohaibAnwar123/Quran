<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*17:1 ``The Aqsa Masjid'' means ``the farthest place where there is prostration,'' many billions of Light Years away. This verse informs us that Muhammad, the soul, was taken to the highest Heaven to be given the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#185">2:185</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch44.html#3">44:3</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch53.html#1">53:1</a>-18, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch97.html#1">97:1</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="13">*17:13 Your life is already recorded, as if on a video tape, from birth to death. This same record will be made accessible to us upon resurrection. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch57.html#22">57:22</a> & Appendix 14.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="46">*17:46 The Arabic word "alone" refers to God in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch7.html#70">7:70</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch39.html#45">39:45</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch40.html#12">40:12</a> & 84, and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch60.html#4">60:4</a>. If you add these numbers, you get 361, 19x19. But if you include <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#46">17:46</a>, which refers to the Quran, the product is not a multiple of 19. "Alone," therefore refers to the Quran in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#46">17:46</a> (Appendix 18).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="60">*17:60 Muhammad's journey to the highest heaven to receive the Quran, as stated in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#1">17:1</a> and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch53.html#1">53:1</a>-18, is a test because the people had to believe Muhammad on faith.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="66">*17:66 We now learn from physics and physical chemistry that water possesses unique qualities that render it perfectly suitable for serving our various needs.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="93">*17:93 God's Messenger of the Covenant, Rashad Khalifa, was thus challenged, including the challenge to bring a new book, or bring down masses from the sky. Verse <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a> defines the duties of God's Messenger of the Covenant. Overwhelming proof is detailed in Appendices 2 & 26.</P>
