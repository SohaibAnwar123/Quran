<p class="footnote"><A NAME="27">*23:27 The story tellers have created a mockery of Noah's history. Noah's ark was a flat watercraft made of logs, tied together with primitive ropes (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch54.html#13">54:13</a>), the flood was local, around the Dead Sea area, and the animals were Noah's domesticated animals.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="84">*23:84-89 Belief in God is valid only if one recognizes God's qualities, such as the fact that God controls everything (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#17">8:17</a>). Believers who do not know God are not really believers. Most believers nullify their belief by idolizing such powerless idols as the prophets and saints (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#106">6:106</a>).</P>
