</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[37:7] We guarded it from every evil devil.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[37:8] They cannot spy on the High Society; they get bombarded from every side.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[37:9] They have been condemned; they have incurred an eternal retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[37:10] If any of them ventures to charge the outer limits, he gets struck with a fierce projectile.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[37:11] Ask them, "Are they more difficult to create, or the other creations?" We created them from wet mud.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[37:12] While you are awed, they mock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[37:13] When reminded, they take no heed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[37:14] When they see proof, they ridicule it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[37:15] They say, "This is obviously magic!
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[37:16] "After we die and become dust and bones, do we get resurrected?
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[37:17] "Even our ancient ancestors?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[37:18] Say, "Yes, you will be forcibly summoned."
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[37:19] All it takes is one nudge, whereupon they (stand up) looking.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[37:20] They will say, "Woe to us; this is the Day of Judgment."
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[37:21] This is the day of decision that you used to disbelieve in.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[37:22] Summon the transgressors, and their spouses, and the idols they worshiped
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[37:23] beside GOD, and guide them to the path of Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[37:24] Stop them, and ask them:
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[37:25] "Why do you not help one another?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[37:26] They will be, on that day, totally submitting.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual Blaming</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="27">[37:27] They will come to each other, questioning and blaming one another.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[37:28] They will say (to their leaders), "You used to come to us from the right side."
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[37:29] They will respond, "It is you who were not believers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[37:30] "We never had any power over you; it is you who were wicked.

<P><A NAME="31">[37:31] "We justly incurred our Lord's judgment; now we have to suffer.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[37:32] "We misled you, only because we were astray."
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[37:33] Thus, together they will all partake of the retribution on that day.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[37:34] This is how we requite the guilty.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Commandment</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="35">[37:35] When they were told, "Laa Elaaha Ella Allah [There is no other god beside GOD]," they turned arrogant.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[37:36] They said, "Shall we leave our gods for the sake of a crazy poet?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[37:37] In fact, he has brought the truth, and has confirmed the messengers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[37:38] Most assuredly, you will taste the most painful retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[37:39] You are requited only for what you have done.
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[37:40] Only GOD's servants who are absolutely devoted to Him alone (will be saved).
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[37:41] They have deserved provisions that are reserved specifically for them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[37:42] All kinds of fruits. They will be honored.
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[37:43] In the gardens of bliss.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[37:44] On furnishings close to one another.
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[37:45] Cups of pure drinks will be offered to them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[37:46] Clear and delicious for the drinkers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[37:47] Never polluted, and never exhausted.
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[37:48] With them will be wonderful companions.
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[37:49] Protected like fragile eggs.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwellers of Heaven Visit the Dwellers of Hell</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="50">[37:50] They will come to each other, and confer with one another.
</P>
<P><A NAME="51">[37:51] One of them will say, "I used to have a friend.
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[37:52] "He used to mock: `Do you believe all this?
</P>
<P><A NAME="53">[37:53] " `After we die and turn into dust and bones, do we get called to account?' "
</P>
<P><A NAME="54">[37:54] He will say, "Just take a look!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="55">[37:55] When he looks, he will see his friend in the heart of Hell.*
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch37fn.html#55">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="56">[37:56] He (will go to him and) say, "By GOD, you almost ruined me.

<P><A NAME="57">[37:57] "If it were not for my Lord's blessing, I would have been with you now.
</P>
<P><A NAME="58">[37:58] "(Do you still believe) that we die,
</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[37:59] "only the first death, and we never receive any requital?"
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redemption: The Greatest Triumph</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="60">[37:60] Such is the greatest triumph.
</P>
<P><A NAME="61">[37:61] This is what every worker should work for.
</P>
<P><A NAME="62">[37:62] Is this a better destiny, or the tree of bitterness?
</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[37:63] We have rendered it a punishment for the transgressors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="64">[37:64] It is a tree that grows in the heart of Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[37:65] Its flowers look like the devils' heads.
</P>
<P><A NAME="66">[37:66] They will eat from it until their bellies are filled up.
</P>
<P><A NAME="67">[37:67] Then they will top it with a hellish drink.
</P>
<P><A NAME="68">[37:68] Then they will return to Hell.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They Followed Their Parents Blindly</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="69">[37:69] They found their parents astray.
</P>
<P><A NAME="70">[37:70] And they blindly followed in their footsteps.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victory for the Messengers Guaranteed</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="71">[37:71] Most of the previous generations have strayed in the same manner.
</P>
<P><A NAME="72">[37:72] We have sent to them warners.
</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[37:73] Note the consequences for those who have been warned.
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[37:74] Only GOD's servants who are absolutely devoted to Him alone (are saved).
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noah</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="75">[37:75] Thus, Noah called upon us, and we were the best responders.
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[37:76] We saved him and his family from the great disaster.
</P>
<P><A NAME="77">[37:77] We made his companions the survivors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="78">[37:78] And we preserved his history for subsequent generations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="79">[37:79] Peace be upon Noah among the peoples.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="83">[37:83] Among his followers was Abraham.
</P>
<P><A NAME="84">[37:84] He came to his Lord wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="85">[37:85] He said to his father and his people, "What are you worshiping?
</P>
<P><A NAME="86">[37:86] "Is it these fabricated gods, instead of GOD, that you want?
</P>
<P><A NAME="87">[37:87] "What do you think of the Lord of the universe?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="88">[37:88] He looked carefully at the stars.
</P>
<P><A NAME="89">[37:89] Then he gave up and said, "I am tired of this!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="90">[37:90] They turned away from him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="91">[37:91] He then turned on their idols, saying, "Would you like to eat?
</P>
<P><A NAME="92">[37:92] "Why do you not speak?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="93">[37:93] He then destroyed them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="94">[37:94] They went to him in a great rage.
</P>
<P><A NAME="95">[37:95] He said, "How can you worship what you carve?
</P>
<P><A NAME="96">[37:96] "When GOD has created you, and everything you make!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="97">[37:97] They said, "Let us build a great fire, and throw him into it."
</P>
<P><A NAME="98">[37:98] They schemed against him, but we made them the losers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="99">[37:99] He said, "I am going to my Lord; He will guide me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="100">[37:100] "My Lord, grant me righteous children."

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satanic Dream*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="102">[37:102] When he grew enough to work with him, he said, "My son, I see in a dream that I am sacrificing you. What do you think?" He said, "O my father, do what you are commanded to do. You will find me, GOD willing, patient."
<BR>
<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch37fn.html#102">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="103">[37:103] They both submitted, and he put his forehead down (to sacrifice him).
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Intervenes to Save Abraham and Ismail</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="104">[37:104] We called him: "O Abraham.
</P>
<P><A NAME="105">[37:105] "You have believed the dream." We thus reward the righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="106">[37:106] That was an exacting test indeed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="107">[37:107] We ransomed (Ismail) by substituting an animal sacrifice.

</P>
<P><A NAME="141">[37:141] He rebelled and thus, he joined the losers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="142">[37:142] Consequently, the fish swallowed him, and he was the one to blame.
</P>
<P><A NAME="143">[37:143] If it were not that he resorted to meditation (on God),
</P>
<P><A NAME="144">[37:144] he would have stayed in its belly until the Day of Resurrection.
</P>
<P><A NAME="145">[37:145] We had him thrown up into the desert, exhausted.
</P>
<P><A NAME="146">[37:146] We had a tree of edible fruit grown for him.

</P>
<P><A NAME="149">[37:149] Ask them if your Lord have daughters, while they have sons!
</P>
<P><A NAME="150">[37:150] Did we create the angels to be females? Did they witness that?
</P>
<P><A NAME="151">[37:151] Indeed, they grossly blaspheme when they say -
</P>
<P><A NAME="152">[37:152] "GOD has begotten a son." Indeed, they are liars.
</P>
<P><A NAME="153">[37:153] Did He choose the girls over the boys?

<P><A NAME="154">[37:154] What is wrong with your logic?

</P>
<P><A NAME="157">[37:157] Show us your book, if you are truthful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="158">[37:158] They even invented a special relationship between Him and the jinns. The jinns themselves know that they are subservient.
</P>
<P><A NAME="159">[37:159] GOD be glorified; far above their claims.
</P>
<P><A NAME="160">[37:160] Only GOD's servants who are devoted to Him alone (are saved).
</P>
<P><A NAME="161">[37:161] Indeed, you and what you worship.
</P>
<P><A NAME="162">[37:162] Cannot impose anything on Him.
