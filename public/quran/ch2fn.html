<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*2:1 These initials remained a divinely guarded secret for 1400 years. Now we recognize them as a major component of the Quran's mathematical miracle (see Appendices 1, 2, 24, and 26). The meaning of A.L.M. is pointed out in Verse 2: "This scripture is infallible." This is incontrovertibly proven by the fact that the frequencies of occurrence of these three initials in this sura are 4502, 3202, and 2195, respectively. The sum of these numbers is 9899, or 19x521. Thus, these most frequent letters of the Arabic language are mathematically placed according to a super-human pattern. These same initials also prefix Suras 3, 29, 30, 31, and 32, and their frequencies of occurrence add up to multiples of 19 in each one of these suras.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="3">*2:3 Since the Contact Prayers are decreed five times a day, they constitute the prime source of nourishment for our souls. Along with all other practices in Submission, the Contact Prayers were originally revealed through Abraham (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch21.html#73">21:73</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#78">22:78</a>). Although these five daily prayers were practiced before the revelation of the Quran, each Contact Prayer is specifically mentioned in the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch24.html#58">24:58</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch11.html#114">11:114</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#78">17:78</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#238">2:238</a>). Appendices 1 & 15 provide physical evidence supporting ALL the details of the Contact Prayers, including the number of units (Rak'aas) and the numbers of bowings, prostrations, and Tashahhuds in each prayer. <BR>
<BR>
**2:3 When God uses the plural tense, this indicates that other entities, usually the angels, are involved. When God spoke to Moses, the singular form was used (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch20.html#12">20:12</a>-14). See Appendix 10.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="4">*2:4 Despite severe distortions that afflicted the previous scriptures, God's truth can still be found in them. Both the Old Testament and the New Testatment still advocate absolute devotion to God ALONE (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Mark 12:29-30). All distortions are easily detectable.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="6">*2:6-7 Those who make a decision to reject God are helped in that direction; they are prevented by God from seeing any proof or guidance for as long as they maintain such a decision. The consequences of such a disastrous decision are spelled out in Verse 7.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="20">*2:20 ``He'' and ``she'' do not necessarily imply natural gender in Arabic (Appendix 4).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="23">*2:23-24 The Quran's miraculous mathematical code provides numerous proofs as it spells out the name "Rashad Khalifa" as God's servant mentioned here. Some literary giants, including Al-Mutanabby and Taha Hussein, have answered the literary challenge, but they had no awareness of the Quran's mathematical composition. It is the Quran's mathematical code, revealed through God's Messenger of the Covenant, Rashad Khalifa, that is the real challenge - for it can never be imitated. See Appendices 1, 2, 24, & 26 for the detailed proofs.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="26">*2:26 See Appendix 5 for further discussion of Heaven and Hell.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="28">*2:28 The righteous do not really die; they go straight to Heaven. When their interim on this earth comes to an end, the angels of death simply invite them to go to the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#154">2:154</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#169">3:169</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#24">8:24</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#58">22:58</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#32">16:32</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch36.html#20">36:20</a>-27, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch44.html#56">44:56</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch89.html#27">89:27</a>-30). Thus, while the righteous experience only the first death following our original sin, the unrighteous go through two deaths (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch40.html#11">40:11</a>). At the time of death, the disbelievers know their miserable fate (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#50">8:50</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch47.html#27">47:27</a>), then they suffer a continuous nightmare that lasts until Hell is created (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch40.html#46">40:46</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch89.html#23">89:23</a>, Appendix 17).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="29">*2:29 Our universe with its billion galaxies, spanning distances of billions of light years, is the smallest and innermost of seven universes (Appendix 6). Please look up <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch41.html#10">41:10</a>-11.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="30">*2:30-37 These verses answer such crucial questions as: ``Why are we here?'' (See Appendix 7).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="31">*2:31 These are the names of the animals, the automobile, the submarine, the space satellite, the VCR, and all other objects to be encountered by the human beings on Earth.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="37">*2:37 Similarly, God has given us specific, mathematically coded words, the words of Sura 1, to establish contact with Him (see Footnote <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch1.html#1">1:1</a> and Appendix 15).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="51">*2:51 This incident reflects the humans' idolatrous tendency. Despite the profound miracles, Moses' followers worshiped the calf in his absence, and Moses ended up with only two believers (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#23">5:23</a>). As pointed out in the Introduction, the humans are rebels whose egos are their gods.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="54">*2:54 It is the ego that led to Satan's fall. It is the ego that caused our exile to this world, and it is the ego that is keeping most of us from redemption to God's Kingdom.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="55">*2:55 It is noteworthy that the word "GOD" in this verse is the 19th occurrence, and this is the verse where the people demanded "physical evidence." The Quran's mathematical code, based on the number 19, provides such physical evidence. Note also that 2+55=57=19x3.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="67">*2:67 Although this sura contains important laws and commandments, including the contact prayers, fasting, Hajj pilgrimage, and the laws of marriage, divorce, etc., the name given to the sura is "The Heifer." This reflects the crucial importance of submission to God and immediate, unwavering obedience to our Creator. Such submission proves our belief in God's omnipotence and absolute authority. See also the Bible's Book of Numbers, Chapter 19.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="80">*2:80-82 It is an established belief among corrupted Muslims that they will suffer in Hell only in proportion to the number of sins they had committed, then they will get out of Hell and go to Heaven. They also believe that Muhammad will intercede on their behalf, and will take them out of Hell. Such beliefs are contrary to the Quran (Appendix 8).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="101">*2:101 God's Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied in the Old Testament (Malachi 3:1-3), the New Testament (Luke 17:22-37), and this Final Testament (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="104">*2:104 The word "Raa`ena"  was abused by some Hebrew-speaking people, and twisted to sound like a dirty word (see also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch4.html#46">4:46</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="106">*2:106 The Quran's mathematical miracle is perpetual & greater than previous miracles (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch34.html#45">34:45</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#35">74:35</a>). Like the Quran itself, it confirms, consummates, and supersedes all previous miracles.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="111">*2:111-112 See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#62">2:62</a> and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#69">5:69</a>.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="112">*2:111-112 See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#62">2:62</a> and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#69">5:69</a>.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="119">*2:119 It is my obligation to point out that the identity of this messenger is confirmed to be "Rashad Khalifa," God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (119), we get 1349, a multiple of 19. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a> and Appendix Two.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="135">*2:135 The Quran repeatedly informs us that Submission is the religion of Abraham (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#95">3:95</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch4.html#125">4:125</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#161">6:161</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#78">22:78</a>). Abraham received a practical "scripture," namely, all the duties and practices of Submission [the Contact Prayers (Salat), the obligatory charity (Zakat), the fasting of Ramadan, and the Hajj pilgrimage]. Muhammad was a follower of Abraham's religion, as we see in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#123">16:123</a>; he delivered this Final Testament, the Quran. The third messenger of Submission  delivered the religion's proof of authenticity (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a> and Appendices 1, 2, 24, & 26).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="142">*2:142-145 "Qiblah" is the direction one faces during the Contact Prayers (Salat). When Gabriel conveyed to Muhammad the command to face Jerusalem instead of Mecca, the hypocrites were exposed. The Arabs were strongly prejudiced in favor of the Ka`aba as their "Qiblah." Only the true believers were able to overcome their prejudices; they readily obeyed the messenger.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="149">*2:149 A glaring proof of the idolatry committed by today's "Muslims" is the designation of Muhammad's tomb as a "Sacred Masjid." The Quran mentions only one "Sacred Masjid."</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="154">*2:154 The righteous do not really die; they simply leave their bodies here and go to the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived. See Appendix 17 for the proof and the details.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="155">*2:155 The test is designed to prove that we worship God alone under all circumstances (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch29.html#2">29:2</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="165">*2:165-166 Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, Ali, and the saints will disown their idolizers on the Day of Resurrection. See also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#86">16:86</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch35.html#14">35:14</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#6">46:6</a>, and the Gospel of Matthew 7:21-23.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="166">*2:165-166 Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, Ali, and the saints will disown their idolizers on the Day of Resurrection. See also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#86">16:86</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch35.html#14">35:14</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#6">46:6</a>, and the Gospel of Matthew 7:21-23.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="172">*2:172-173 Throughout the Quran, only four meats are prohibited (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#145">6:145</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#115">16:115</a>, Appendix 16). Dietary prohibitions beyond these four are tantamount to idol worship (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#121">6:121</a>,148,150; <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch7.html#32">7:32</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="174">*2:174-176 Despite their recognition of God's mathematical miracle in the Quran, the corrupted religious leaders tried for many years to conceal this awesome miracle. Many of them admitted that they resented the fact that Rashad Khalifa, not them, was blessed with the miracle.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="178"><a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#178">2:178</a> The Quran clearly discourages capital punishment. Every kind of excuse is provided to spare lives, including the life of the murderer. The victim's kin may find it better, under certain circumstances, to spare the life of the murderer in exchange for an equitable compensation. Also capital punishment is not applicable if, for example, a woman kills a man, or vice versa.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="183">*2:183-187 Like all duties in Submission, fasting was decreed through Abraham (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#78">22:78</a>, Appendices 9 & 15). Prior to revelation of the Quran, sexual intercourse was prohibited throughout the fasting period. This rule is modified in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#187">2:187</a> to allow intercourse during the nights of Ramadan.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="189">*2:189 The literal Quranic idiom says: "Do not enter the homes through the back doors." The question about the phases of the moon is an example of beating around the bush; there were bad ulterior motives behind this question.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="190">*2:190 All fighting is regulated by the basic rule in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch60.html#8">60:8</a>-9. Fighting is allowed strictly in self-defense, while aggression and oppression are strongly condemned throughout the Quran.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="196">*2:196 See the details of Hajj and `Umrah in Appendix 15.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="197">*2:197 Hajj can be observed any time during the Sacred Months: Zul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and Rabi I. Local governments restrict Hajj to a few days for their own convenience. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#37">9:37</a></P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="210">*2:210 This world is a test; it is our last chance to restore ourselves back into God's kingdom by denouncing idol worship (see the INTRODUCTION). If God and His angels show up, everyone will believe, and the test will no longer be valid.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="211">*2:211 The Quran's mathematical miracle is a great blessing, and brings with it an awesome responsibility (please see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#115">5:115</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="213">*2:213 All worshipers of God ALONE, from all religions, are truly united.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="219">*2:219 The world now recognizes that the economic benefits from manufacturing alcoholic beverages and illicit drugs are not worth the traffic fatalities, brain damage to children of alcoholic mothers, family crises, and other disastrous consequences. Check with "Alcoholics Anonymous" and "Gamblers Anonymous" for more information. See also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#90">5:90</a>-91.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="238">*2:238 All five prayers are found in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#238">2:238</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch11.html#114">11:114</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#78">17:78</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch24.html#58">24:58</a>. When the Quran was revealed, the Contact Prayers (Salat) had already been in existence (Appendix 9). The details of all five prayers - what to recite and the number of units (Rak`aas) per prayer, etc. - are mathematically confirmed. For example, writing down the number of units for each of the five prayers, next to each other, we get 24434, 19x1286. Also, if we use [*] to represent Sura 1 (Al-Faatehah), where [*]=the sura number (1), followed by the number of verses (7), followed by the number of each verse, the number of letters in each verse, and the gematrical value of every letter, writing down 2[*][*]4[*][*][*][*]4[*][*][*][*]3[*][*][*]4[*][*][*][*] produces a multiple of 19 (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch1.html#1">1:1</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="246">*2:246 This same history is narrated in the Bible's Book of I Samuel, Ch. 9 and 10.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="252">*2:252 In keeping with the mathematical composition of the Quran, God has willed that the name of the messenger mentioned here shall be spelled out mathematically. The discovery of the Quran's miraculous 19-based code has been divinely reserved for God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding this verse number (252), plus the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of "Khalifa" (725) we get 252+505+725 = 1482, or 19x78. Please see Appendices 2 and 26 for the complete details related to the proven identity of God's Messenger of the Covenant, to whom this verse clearly refers.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="254">*2:254 One of Satan's clever tricks is attributing the power of intercession to powerless human idols such as Jesus and Muhammad (Appendix 8).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="259">*2:259 The lesson we learn here is that the period of death - only the unrighteous die; the righteous go straight to Heaven - passes like one day (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#19">18:19</a>-25 and Appendix 17).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="275">*2:275-278 It is an established economic principle that excessive interest on loans can utterly destroy a whole country. During the last few years we have witnessed the devastation of the economies of many nations where excessive interest is charged. Normal interest - less than 20% - where no one is victimized and everyone is satisfied, is not usury.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="282">*2:282 Financial transactions are the ONLY situations where two women may substitute for one man as witness. This is to guard against the real possibility that one witness may marry the other witness, and thus cause her to be biased. It is a recognized fact that women are more emotionally vulnerable than men.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="285"><a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#285">2:285</a> One of the major commandments is: "You shall not make any distinction among God's messengers" (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#136">2:136</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#84">3:84</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch4.html#150">4:150</a>). The believers react by saying, "We hear and we obey," while the idol worshipers argue back to justify their insistence upon mentioning Muhammad's name next to God's, to the exclusion of all other messengers. The corrupted Muslims mention Muhammad in their profession of faith (Shahaadah) and during their Contact Prayers (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch72.html#18">72:18</a>).</P>
