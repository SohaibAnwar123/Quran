</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[71:1] We sent Noah to his people: "You shall warn your people before a painful retribution afflicts them."
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[71:2] He said, "O my people, I am a manifest warner to you.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[71:3] "To alert you that you shall worship GOD, reverence Him, and obey me.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[71:4] "He will then forgive you your sins and respite you for a predetermined period. Most assuredly, GOD's appointment can never be delayed, once it is due, if you only knew."
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[71:5] He said, "My Lord, I have invited my people night and day.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[71:6] "But my invitation only increased their aversion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[71:7] "Whenever I invited them to be forgiven by You, they placed their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their clothes, insisted, and turned arrogant.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[71:8] "Then I invited them publicly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[71:9] "Then I proclaimed to them loudly, and I spoke to them privately.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[71:10] "I said, `Implore your Lord for forgiveness; He is Forgiving.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[71:11] " `He will then shower you generously with rain.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[71:12] " `And provide you with money and children, and orchards, and streams.' "
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[71:13] Why should you not strive to reverence GOD?
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[71:14] He is the One who created you in stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[71:15] Do you not realize that GOD created seven universes in layers?
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[71:18] Then He returns you into it, and He will surely bring you out.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[71:19] GOD made the earth habitable for you.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[71:20] That you may build roads therein.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[71:21] Noah said, "My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed those who were even more corrupted when blessed with money and children.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[71:22] "They schemed terrible schemes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[71:23] "They said, `Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon Wadd, Suwaa`, Yaghouth, Ya`ooq, and Nasr.'
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[71:24] "They misled many. Therefore, let the wicked plunge deeper into loss."
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[71:25] Because of their sins they were drowned and assigned to the hellfire. They found no helpers to protect them from GOD.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[71:26] Noah also said, "My Lord, do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[71:27] "For if you let them, they will only mislead your servants and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[71:28] "My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home as a believer, and all the believing men and women. But do not give the disbelievers anything but annihilation."
