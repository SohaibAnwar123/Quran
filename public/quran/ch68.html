</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[68:1] NuN,* the pen, and what they (the people) write.

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch68fn.html#1">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[68:2] You have attained a great blessing from your Lord; you are not crazy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[68:3] You have attained a recompense that is well deserved.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[68:4] You are blessed with a great moral character.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[68:5] You will see, and they will see.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[68:6] Which of you are condemned.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[68:7] Your Lord is fully aware of those who strayed off His path, and He is fully aware of those who are guided.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[68:8] Do not obey the rejectors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[68:9] They wish that you compromise, so they too can compromise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[68:10] Do not obey every lowly swearer.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[68:11] A slanderer, a backbiter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[68:12] Forbidder of charity, a transgressor, a sinner.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[68:13] Unappreciative, and greedy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[68:14] Even though he possessed enough money and children.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[68:15] When our revelations are recited to him, he says, "Tales from the past!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[68:16] We will mark his face.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[68:17] We have tested them like we tested the owners of the garden who swore that they will harvest it in the morning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[68:18] They were so absolutely sure.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[68:19] A passing (storm) from your Lord passed by it while they were asleep.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[68:20] By morning, it was barren.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[68:21] They called on each other in the morning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[68:22] "Let us harvest the crop."
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[68:23] On their way, they confided to each other.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[68:24] That from then on, none of them would be poor.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[68:25] They were so absolutely sure of their harvest.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[68:26] But when they saw it, they said, "We were so wrong!
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[68:27] "Now, we have nothing!"
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They Should Have Said: "God Willing."</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="28">[68:28] The righteous among them said, "If only you had glorified (God)!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[68:29] They said, "Glory be to our Lord. We have transgressed."
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[68:30] They started to blame each other.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[68:31] They said, "Woe to us. We sinned.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[68:32] "May our Lord grant us a better one. We repent to our Lord."
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[68:33] Such was the requital. But the retribution of the Hereafter is far worse, if they only knew.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[68:34] The righteous have deserved, at their Lord, gardens of bliss.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[68:35] Shall we treat the Submitters like the criminals?
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[68:36] What is wrong with your logic?
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[68:37] Do you have another book to uphold?
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[68:38] In it, do you find anything you want?
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[68:39] Or, have you received solemn assurances from us that grant you whatever you wish on the Day of Resurrection?
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[68:40] Ask them, "Who guarantees this for you?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[68:41] Do they have idols? Let their idols help them, if they are truthful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[68:42] The day will come when they will be exposed, and they will be required to fall prostrate, but they will be unable to.
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[68:43] With their eyes subdued, humiliation will cover them. They were invited to fall prostrate when they were whole and able.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[68:44] Therefore, let Me deal with those who reject this Hadith; we will lead them on whence they never perceive.
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[68:45] I will give them enough rope; My scheming is formidable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[68:46] Are you asking them for money, so they are burdened by the fine?
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[68:47] Do they know the future? Do they have it recorded?
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[68:48] You shall steadfastly persevere in carrying out the commands of your Lord. Do not be like (Jonah) who called from inside the fish.
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[68:49] If it were not for his Lord's grace, he would have been ejected into the desert as a sinner.
</P>
<P><A NAME="50">[68:50] But his Lord blessed him, and made him righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="51">[68:51] Those who disbelieved show their ridicule in their eyes when they hear the message and say, "He is crazy!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[68:52] It is in fact a message to the world.
