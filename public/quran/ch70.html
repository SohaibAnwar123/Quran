</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[70:4] The angels, with their reports, climb to Him in a day that equals fifty thousand years.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[70:5] Therefore, you shall resort to a gracious patience.
</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[70:12] Also his spouse, and his brother.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[70:13] Even his whole tribe that raised him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[70:14] Even all the people on earth, if it would save him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[70:15] No; it is aflame.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[70:16] Eager to burn.

<P><A NAME="21">[70:21] If blessed by wealth, stingy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[70:22] Except for the worshipers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[70:23] Who always observe their contact prayers (Salat).
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[70:24] Part of their money is set aside.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[70:25] For the poor and the needy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[70:26] They believe in the Day of Judgment.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[70:27] They reverence their Lord's requital.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[70:28] Their Lord's requital is not taken for granted.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[70:29] They keep their chastity.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs -
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[70:31] anyone who transgresses these limits is a sinner.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[70:32] And the believers keep their word; they are trustworthy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[70:33] Their testimony is truthful.

<P><A NAME="34">[70:34] They consistently observe their contact prayers (Salat) on time.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[70:35] They have deserved a position of honor in Paradise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[70:36] What is keeping those who disbelieved from joining you?
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[70:37] To the right, and to the left, they flee.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[70:38] How can any of them expect to enter the blissful Paradise?
</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[70:40] I solemnly swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests; we are able -
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[70:41] to substitute better people in your place; we can never be defeated.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[70:42] Therefore, let them blunder and play, until they meet the day that is awaiting them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[70:43] That is the day they come out of the graves in a hurry, as if herded to the (sacrificial) altars.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[70:44] With their eyes subdued, shame will cover them. That is the day that is awaiting them.
