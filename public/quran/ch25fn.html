<p class="footnote"><A NAME="2">*25:2 When we launch astronauts into space, we measure precisely the amount of food, water, oxygen, and other needs throughout the journey. Similarly, God has launched us into space - on board spaceship Earth - and He has designed all kinds of renewable provisions for us and other creatures, a perfect design. Think, for example, of the symbiotic relationship between us and the plants; we use the oxygen they produce in photosynthesis, while they use the carbon dioxide we produce in respiration.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="5">*25:5 Muhammad's contemporaries knew that he was a literate man who could read and write; he wrote God's revelations with his own hand (see Appendix 28).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="6">*25:6 The Quran's miraculous mathematical code, the incontrovertible answer to the disbelievers' claims, remained a divinely guarded secret for 1400 years. God's Messenger of the Covenant was destined to unveil it by God's leave (Appendices 1, 2, & 26).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="27">*25:27-30 This verse refers also to God's Messenger of the Covenant whose name is mathematically coded in the Quran as ``Rashad Khalifa.'' If you write down the gematrical value of ``Rashad'' (505), followed by the gematrical value of ``Khalifa'' (725), followed by this sura number (25), followed by verses 27, 28, 29, and 30, the final number (5057252527282930) is a multiple of 19 (see Appendices 2 & 26 for details). The prophet Muhammad will also make such a statement as in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch25.html#30">25:30</a> on the Day of Judgment.</P>

<p class="footnote"><A NAME="56">*25:56 The gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), plus the sura and verse number (25+56) give a total of 1230+25+56=1311=19x69.</P>
