<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*11:1 Our generation is fortunate to witness two awesome phenomena in the Quran: (1) an extraordinary mathematical code (Appendix 1), and (2) a literary miracle of incredible dimensions. If humans attempt to write a mathematically structured work, the numerical manipulations will adversely affect the literary quality. The Quran sets the standard for literary excellence.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="7">*11:7 The six days are simply a yardstick providing us with a lot of information. Thus, we learn that the vast lifeless physical universe was created in two days, while the tiny mote called ``Earth'' was created in four days (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch41.html#10">41:10</a>-12). The provision of food, water, and oxygen for the earth's inhabitants had to be precisely calculated and arranged. <BR>
<BR>
**11:7 The earth was initially covered with water. Subsequently, the land mass emerged, and the continents drifted apart.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="13">*11:13 The Quran's mathematical miracle is inimitable (See Appendix 1).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="17">*11:17 The Quran's 19-based mathematical code is a built-in proof of divine authorship. It is noteworthy that the word ``Bayyinah'' (proof) is mentioned in the Quran 19 times. <BR>
<BR>
**11:17 As it turns out, Moses' book was also mathematically composed, with ``19'' as the common denominator. See Footnote <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#10">46:10</a> and Appendix 1.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="40">*11:40 & 44 This is God's proven truth: Noah's ark was made of logs, tied together with primitive ropes (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch54.html#13">54:13</a>). Contrary to common belief, the flood was limited to the area around today's Dead Sea, and the animals were Noah's livestock only; not every animal that lived on earth.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="44">*11:40 & 44 This is God's proven truth: Noah's ark was made of logs, tied together with primitive ropes (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch54.html#13">54:13</a>). Contrary to common belief, the flood was limited to the area around today's Dead Sea, and the animals were Noah's livestock only; not every animal that lived on earth.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="46">*11:46 Intercession is Satan's most effective bait to entice people into idol worship. However, Abraham could not help his father, nor could Noah help his son, nor could Muhammad help his own relatives (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#254">2:254</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#80">9:80</a> & 114).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="119">*11:119 The Most Merciful has created us on this earth to give us yet another chance to denounce our original crime and to be redeemed (see the Introduction and Appendix 7). <BR>
<BR>
**11:119 God does not put a single person in Hell; they choose and insist upon going to Hell.</P>
