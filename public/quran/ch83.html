<P><A NAME="1">[83:1] Woe to the cheaters.
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[83:2] Who demand full measure when receiving from the people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[83:3] But when giving them the measures or weights, they cheat.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[83:4] Do they not know that they will be resurrected?
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[83:5] On a tremendous day?
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[83:6] That is the day when all people will stand before the Lord of the universe.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerically Structured Books</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="7">[83:7] Indeed, the book of the wicked is in Sijjeen.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[83:8] Do you know what Sijjeen is?
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[83:9] A numerically structured book.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[83:10] Woe on that day to the rejectors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[83:11] They do not believe in the Day of Judgment.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[83:12] None disbelieves therein except the transgressor, the sinful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[83:13] When our revelations are recited to him, he says, "Tales from the past!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[83:14] Indeed, their hearts have become shielded by their sins.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[83:15] Indeed, they will be isolated, on that day, from their Lord.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[83:16] Then they will be thrown into Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[83:17] They will be told, "This is what you used to deny."
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[83:18] Indeed, the book of the righteous will be in `Elleyyeen.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[83:19] Do you know what `Elleyyeen is?
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[83:20] A numerically structured book.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[83:21] To be witnessed by those close to Me.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[83:22] The righteous have deserved bliss.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[83:23] On luxurious furnishings they watch.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[83:24] You recognize in their faces the joy of bliss.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[83:25] Their drinks will be spiced with nectar.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[83:26] Its spice is like musk. This is what the competitors should compete for.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[83:27] Mixed into it will be special flavors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[83:28] From a spring that is reserved for those close to Me.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[83:29] The wicked used to laugh at those who believed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[83:30] When they passed by them, they used to poke fun.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[83:31] When they got together with their people, they used to joke.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[83:32] Whenever they saw them, they said, "These people are far astray!
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[83:33] "They have no such thing as (invisible) guards."
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[83:34] Today, those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[83:35] On luxurious furnishings they watch.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[83:36] Most assuredly, the disbelievers are requited for what they did.
