</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[89:1] By the dawn.
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[89:2] And the ten nights.*

<P><A NAME="3">[89:3] By the even and the odd.*

</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[89:4] By the night as it passes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[89:5] A profound oath, for one who possesses intelligence.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[89:6] Have you noted what your Lord did to `Aad?
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[89:7] Erum; the town with tall buildings.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[89:8] There was nothing like it anywhere.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[89:9] Also Thamoud, who carved the rocks in their valley.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[89:10] And Pharaoh who possessed might.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[89:11] They all transgressed in the land.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[89:12] They spread evil throughout.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[89:13] Consequently, your Lord poured upon them a whipping retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[89:14] Your Lord is ever watchful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[89:15] When the human being is tested by his Lord, through blessings and joy, he says, "My Lord is generous towards me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[89:16] But if He tests him through reduction in provisions, he says, "My Lord is humiliating me!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[89:17] Wrong! It is you who brought it on yourselves by not regarding the orphan.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[89:18] And not advocating charity towards the poor.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[89:19] And consuming the inheritance of helpless orphans.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[89:20] And loving the money too much.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[89:21] Indeed, when the earth is crushed, utterly crushed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[89:22] And your Lord comes, together with the angels in row after row.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[89:23] On that day, Gehenna will be brought forth. On that day, the human being will remember - but what a remembrance - it will be too late.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[89:24] He will say, "Oh, I wish I prepared for my (eternal) life."
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[89:25] On that day, no retribution could be worse than His retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[89:26] And no confinement is as effective as His confinement.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[89:27] As for you, O content soul.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[89:28] Return to your Lord, pleased and pleasing.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[89:29] Welcome into My servants.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[89:30] Welcome into My Paradise.
