<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*10:1 These letters constitute a major portion of the Quran's awesome mathematical code and proof of divine authorship. See Appendix 1 for details.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="15">*10:15 The word ``Quran'' is mentioned in the Quran 58 times, but since this verse refers to ``another Quran,'' it must be excluded; "This Quran" is mentioned in the Quran 57 times, 19x3.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="20">*10:20 In retrospect, we see now that the Quran's miracle, indeed "One of the greatest miracles" (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#30">74:30</a>-35), was divinely predestined to be unveiled 14 centuries after Muhammad. In view of the current condition of the traditional Muslims, if Muhammad had been given this miracle, those Muslims, who are already idolizing Muhammad beside God, would have worshiped him as God incarnate. Additionally, this miracle is obviously designed for the computer age, and to be appreciated by mathematically sophisticated generations.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="24">*10:24 God, of course, knows whether His judgment will come during the day, or during the night. But it just happens that the earth will be half day and half night when the end of the world comes. Another ``scientific miracle'' of the Quran.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="62">*10:62-64 Most people think that they have to wait until the Day of Resurrection before they receive their rewards for righteousness, or the retribution for wickedness. But the Quran repeatedly assures the believers that they are guaranteed perfect happiness here in this world, now and forever. At the end of their interim here, they go directly to Paradise (see Appendix 17).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="91">*10:91 Believing in God is the first step. Thereafter, one needs to nourish and develop the soul through the practices of worship (see Appendix 15).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="92">*10:92 God endowed the Egyptians with the exclusive knowledge of mummification. Today, Pharaoh's mummified body is on display at the Cairo Museum.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="99">*10:99-101 The test demands that we denounce idolatry on our own, without divine intervention in our initial decision. God blocks out those who choose to disbelieve.</P>
