</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[75:1] I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[75:2] And I swear by the blaming soul.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[75:3] Does the human being think that we will not reconstruct his bones?
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[75:4] Yes indeed; we are able to reconstruct his finger tip.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[75:5] But the human being tends to believe only what he sees in front of him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[75:6] He doubts the Day of Resurrection!
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[75:7] Once the vision is sharpened.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[75:8] And the moon is eclipsed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[75:9] And the sun and the moon crash into one another.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[75:10] The human being will say on that day, "Where is the escape?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[75:11] Absolutely, there is no escape.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[75:12] To your Lord, on that day, is the final destiny.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[75:13] The human being will be informed, on that day, of everything he did to advance himself, and everything he did to regress himself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[75:14] The human being will be his own judge.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[75:15] No excuses will be accepted.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muhammad Forbidden from Explaining the Quran</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="16">[75:16] Do not move your tongue to hasten it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[75:17] It is we who will collect it into Quran.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[75:18] Once we recite it, you shall follow such a Quran.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[75:19] Then it is we who will explain it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[75:20] Indeed, you love this fleeting life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[75:21] While disregarding the Hereafter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[75:22] Some faces, on that day, will be happy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[75:23] Looking at their Lord.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[75:24] Other faces will be, on that day, miserable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[75:25] Expecting the worst.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[75:26] Indeed, when (the soul) reaches the throat.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[75:27] And it is ordered: "Let go!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[75:28] He knows it is the end.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[75:29] Each leg will lay motionless next to the other leg.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[75:30] To your Lord, on that day, is the summoning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[75:31] For he observed neither the charity, nor the contact prayers (Salat).
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[75:32] But he disbelieved and turned away.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[75:33] With his family, he acted arrogantly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[75:34] You have deserved this.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[75:35] Indeed, you have deserved this.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[75:36] Does the human being think that he will go to nothing?
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[75:37] Was he not a drop of ejected semen?
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[75:38] Then He created an embryo out of it!
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[75:39] He made it into male or female!
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[75:40] Is He then unable to revive the dead?
