<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*38:1 This Initial (Saad) occurs in suras 7, 19, & 38 a total of 152 times, 19x8 (Appendix 1). <BR>
<BR>
**38:1 The word "Zikr" is made distinct from the Quran and clearly points at the Quran's miraculous mathematical code. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch15.html#6">15:6</a>, 9; <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#44">16:44</a>; <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch21.html#2">21:2</a>, 24; <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch26.html#5">26:5</a>; & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch36.html#11">36:11</a>, 69.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="23">*38:23 This is the only place where the number 99 occurs. Thirty different numbers are mentioned in the Quran, and their total comes to 162146, 19x8534. See Appendix 1.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="24">*38:24 In this clear example, 99 on one side vs 1 on the other side, David's extreme care to render the correct judgment caused him to ask forgiveness. Are we this careful?</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="32">*38:32 Solomon missed his afternoon prayer because of his horses. To nullify Satan's possible claim that Solomon loved his horses more than loving God, he got rid of his horses.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="34">*38:34 & 41 Solomon and Job represent both ends of the testing spectrum. We are put to the test through wealth, health, or lack of them, to see if we worship God alone under all circumstances.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="41">*38:34 & 41 Solomon and Job represent both ends of the testing spectrum. We are put to the test through wealth, health, or lack of them, to see if we worship God alone under all circumstances.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="69">*38:69 The feud in the High Society was triggered by Satan's challenge to God's absolute authority. This is definitely the most important event in the history of the human race. We failed to make a firm stand regarding God's absolute authority. This life represents the third and final chance to redeem ourselves (See the Introduction and Appendix 7).</P>
