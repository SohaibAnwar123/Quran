</P>
<P><A NAME="91">[11:91] They said, "O Shu`aib, we do not comprehend many of the things you are telling us, and we see that you are powerless among us. If it were not for your tribe, we would have stoned you. You have no value for us."
</P>
<P><A NAME="92">[11:92] He said, "O my people, does my tribe command a greater respect than GOD? Is this why you have been heedless of Him? My Lord is fully aware of everything you do.
</P>
<P><A NAME="93">[11:93] "O my people, go on doing what you wish, and so will I. You will certainly find out which of us will incur shameful retribution; you will find out who the liar is. Just wait in anticipation, and I will wait in anticipation along with you."

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons to be Learned</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="100">[11:100] This is news from the past communities that we narrate to you. Some are still standing, and some have vanished.
</P>
<P><A NAME="101">[11:101] We never wronged them; they wronged their own souls. Their gods, whom they invoked beside GOD, could not help them in the least when the judgment of your Lord came. In fact, they only ensured their doom.
</P>
<P><A NAME="102">[11:102] Such was the retribution enforced by your Lord when the communities transgressed. Indeed, His retribution is painful, devastating.
</P>
<P><A NAME="103">[11:103] This should be a lesson for those who fear the retribution of the Hereafter. That is a day when all the people will be summoned - a day to be witnessed.

<P><A NAME="104">[11:104] We have appointed a specific time for it to take place.
</P>
<P><A NAME="105">[11:105] The day it comes to pass, no soul will utter a single word, except in accordance with His will. Some will be miserable, and some will be happy.

</P>
<P><A NAME="107">[11:107] Eternally they abide therein, for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, in accordance with the will of your Lord. Your Lord is doer of whatever He wills.
</P>

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Our Parents Blindly A Great Human Tragedy</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="109">[11:109] Do not have any doubt regarding what these people worship; they worship exactly as they found their parents worshiping. We will requite them their due share fully, without reduction.
</P>
<P><A NAME="110">[11:110] We have given Moses the scripture, but it was disputed, and if it were not for a predetermined word decreed by your Lord, they would have been judged immediately. They are full of doubt about this, suspicious.
</P>
<P><A NAME="111">[11:111] Your Lord will surely recompense everyone for their works. He is fully Cognizant of everything they do.
</P>
<P><A NAME="112">[11:112] Therefore, continue on the path you have been enjoined to follow, together with those who repented with you, and do not transgress. He is Seer of everything you do.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the Five Prayers</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="114">[11:114] You shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) at both ends of the day, and during the night. The righteous works wipe out the evil works. This is a reminder for those who would take heed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="115">[11:115] You shall steadfastly persevere, for GOD never fails to recompense the righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="116">[11:116] If only some of those among the previous generations possessed enough intelligence to forbid evil! Only a few of them deserved to be saved by us. As for the transgressors, they were preoccupied with their material luxuries; they were guilty.
</P>
<P><A NAME="117">[11:117] Your Lord never annihilates any community unjustly, while its people are righteous.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Were We Created</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="118">[11:118] Had your Lord willed, all the people would have been one congregation (of believers). But they will always dispute (the truth).
