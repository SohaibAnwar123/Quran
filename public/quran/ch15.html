</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[15:2] Certainly, those who disbelieved will wish they were submitters.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[15:3] Let them eat, enjoy, and remain blinded by wishful thinking; they will find out.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[15:4] We never annihilated any community, except in accordance with a specific, predetermined time.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[15:5] The end of any community can never be advanced, nor delayed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[15:6] They said, "O you who received this reminder, you are crazy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[15:7] "Why do you not bring down the angels, if you are truthful?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[15:8] We do not send down the angels except for specific functions. Otherwise, no one will be respited.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Messenger of the Covenant*</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[15:10] We have sent (messengers) before you to the communities in the past.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[15:11] Every time a messenger went to them, they ridiculed him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[15:12] We thus control the minds of the guilty.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[15:13] Consequently, they cannot believe in him. This has been the system since the past generations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[15:14] Even if we opened for them a gate into the sky, through which they climb;
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[15:15] they will say, "Our eyes have been deceived. We have been bewitched."
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[15:16] We placed galaxies in the sky, and adorned it for the beholders.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[15:17] And we guarded it against every rejected devil.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[15:18] If any of them sneaks around to listen, a mighty projectile will chase him back.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[15:19] As for the earth, we constructed it, and placed on it stabilizers (mountains), and we grew on it a perfect balance of everything.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[15:20] We made it habitable for you,* and for creatures you do not provide for.

</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[15:21] There is nothing that we do not own infinite amounts thereof. But we send it down in precise measure.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[15:22] And we send the winds as pollinators, and cause water to come down from the sky for you to drink. Otherwise, you could not keep it palatable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[15:23] It is we who control life and death, and we are the ultimate inheritors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[15:24] And we fully know those among you who advance, and we fully know those who regress.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[15:25] Your Lord will surely summon them. He is Most Wise, Omniscient.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Race</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="26">[15:26] We created the human being from aged mud, like the potter's clay.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[15:27] As for the jinns, we created them, before that, from blazing fire.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[15:28] Your Lord said to the angels, "I am creating a human being from aged mud, like the potter's clay.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[15:29] "Once I perfect him, and blow into him from My spirit, you shall fall prostrate before him."
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[15:30] The angels fell prostrate; all of them,
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[15:31] except Iblis (Satan). He refused to be with the prostrators.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[15:32] He said, "O Iblis (Satan), why are you not with the prostrators?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[15:33] He said, "I am not to prostrate before a human being, whom You created from aged mud, like the potter's clay."
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[15:34] He said, "Therefore, you must get out; you are banished.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[15:35] "You have incurred My condemnation until the Day of Judgment."
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[15:36] He said, "My Lord, respite me until the day they are resurrected."
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[15:37] He said, "You are respited.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[15:38] "Until the specified day and time."

</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[15:41] He said, "This is a law that is inviolable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[15:42] "You have no power over My servants. You only have power over the strayers who follow you.
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[15:43] "And Hell awaits them all.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[15:44] "It will have seven gates. Each gate will get a specific share of them."
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[15:45] As for the righteous, they will enjoy gardens and springs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[15:46] Enter therein, peaceful and secure.
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[15:47] We remove all jealousy from their hearts. Like one family, they will be on adjacent furnishings.
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[15:48] Never will they suffer any fatigue therein; never will they be evicted therefrom.
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[15:49] Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, Most Merciful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="50">[15:50] And that My retribution is the most painful retribution.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="51">[15:51] Inform them about Abraham's guests.
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[15:52] When they entered his quarters, they said, "Peace." He said, "We are apprehensive about you."
</P>
<P><A NAME="53">[15:53] They said, "Do not be apprehensive. We have good news for you: an enlightened son."
</P>
<P><A NAME="54">[15:54] He said, "How can you give me such good news, when I am so old? Do you still give me this good news?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="55">[15:55] They said, "The good news we give you is true; do not despair."
</P>
<P><A NAME="56">[15:56] He said, "None despairs of his Lord's mercy, except the strayers."
</P>
<P><A NAME="57">[15:57] He said, "What is your mission, O messengers?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="58">[15:58] They said, "We are being dispatched to guilty people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[15:59] "As for Lot's family, we will save them all.
</P>
<P><A NAME="60">[15:60] "But not his wife; she is destined to be with the doomed."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="61">[15:61] The messengers went to Lot's town.
</P>
<P><A NAME="62">[15:62] He said, "You are unknown people."
</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[15:63] They said, "We bring to you what they have been doubting.
</P>
<P><A NAME="64">[15:64] "We bring to you the truth; we are truthful.
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[15:65] "You shall take your family during the night. Stay behind them, and make sure that none of you looks back. Go straight as commanded."
</P>
<P><A NAME="66">[15:66] We delivered to him this command: those people are to be annihilated in the morning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="67">[15:67] The people of the city came joyfully.

<P><A NAME="68">[15:68] He said, "These are my guests; do not embarrass me.
</P>
<P><A NAME="69">[15:69] "Fear GOD, and do not shame me."

</P>
<P><A NAME="71">[15:71] He said, "Here are my daughters, if you must."
</P>
<P><A NAME="72">[15:72] But, alas, they were totally blinded by their lust.
</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[15:73] Consequently, the disaster struck them in the morning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[15:74] We turned it upside down, and showered them with devastating rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="75">[15:75] This is a lesson for those who possess intelligence.
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[15:76] This will always be the system.
</P>
<P><A NAME="77">[15:77] This is a sign for the believers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="78">[15:78] The people of the woods also were transgressors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="79">[15:79] Consequently, we avenged from them, and both communities are fully documented.
</P>
<P><A NAME="80">[15:80] The people of Al-Hijr disbelieved the messengers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="81">[15:81] We gave them our revelations, but they disregarded them.

</P>
<P><A NAME="83">[15:83] The disaster hit them in the morning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="84">[15:84] What they hoarded did not help them.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of the World Unveiled*</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="85">[15:85] We did not create the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, except for a specific purpose. The end of the world will come, so treat them with benign neglect.

<P><A NAME="86">[15:86] Your Lord is the Creator, the Omniscient.
</P>
<P><A NAME="87">[15:87] We have given you the seven pairs, and the great Quran.
</P>
<P><A NAME="88">[15:88] Do not be jealous of what we bestowed upon the other (messengers), and do not be saddened (by the disbelievers), and lower your wing for the believers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="89">[15:89] And proclaim: "I am the manifest warner."
</P>
<P><A NAME="90">[15:90] We will deal with the dividers.

</P>
<P><A NAME="92">[15:92] By your Lord, we will question them all,

</P>
<P><A NAME="95">[15:95] We will spare you the mockers,
</P>
<P><A NAME="96">[15:96] who set up another god beside GOD. They will surely find out.

<P><A NAME="97">[15:97] We know full well that you may be annoyed by their utterances.
</P>
<P><A NAME="98">[15:98] You shall sing the praises of your Lord, and be with the prostrators.
