<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch38fn.html#1">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[38:2] Those who disbelieve have plunged into arrogance and defiance.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[38:3] Many a generation before them we annihilated. They called for help, in vain.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[38:4] They wondered that a warner should come to them, from among them. The disbelievers said, "A magician, a liar.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[38:5] "Did he make the gods into one god? This is really strange."
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[38:6] The leaders announced, "Go and steadfastly persevere in worshiping your gods. This is what is desired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[38:7] "We never heard of this from the religion of our fathers. This is a lie.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[38:8] "Why did the proof come down to him, instead of us?" Indeed, they are doubtful of My proof. Indeed, they have not yet tasted My retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[38:9] Do they own the treasures of mercy of your Lord, the Almighty, the Grantor.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[38:10] Do they possess the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them? Let them help themselves.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[38:11] Instead, whatever forces they can muster - even if all their parties banded together - will be defeated.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[38:12] Disbelieving before them were the people of Noah, `Aad, and the mighty Pharaoh.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[38:13] Also, Thamoud, the people of Lot, the dwellers of the Woods (of Midyan); those were the opponents.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[38:14] Each of them disbelieved the messengers and thus, My retribution was inevitable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[38:15] These people can expect a single blow, from which they never recover.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[38:16] They challenged: "Our Lord, why do you not rush the retribution for us, before the Day of Reckoning."
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[38:17] Be patient in the face of their utterances, and remember our servant David, the resourceful; he was obedient.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[38:18] We committed the mountains in his service, glorifying with him night and day.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[38:19] Also the birds were committed to serve him; all were obedient to him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[38:20] We strengthened his kingship, and endowed him with wisdom and good logic.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[38:21] Have you received news of the feuding men who sneaked into his sanctuary?
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[38:22] When they entered his room, he was startled. They said, "Have no fear. We are feuding with one another, and we are seeking your fair judgment. Do not wrong us, and guide us in the right path.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[38:23] "This brother of mine owns ninety nine* sheep, while I own one sheep. He wants to mix my sheep with his, and continues to pressure me."

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's Exemplary Piety</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="24">[38:24] He said, "He is being unfair to you by asking to combine your sheep with his. Most people who combine their properties treat each other unfairly, except those who believe and work righteousness, and these are so few." Afterwards, David wondered if he made the right judgment. He thought that we were testing him. He then implored his Lord for forgiveness, bowed down, and repented.*

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch38fn.html#24">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[38:25] We forgave him in this matter. We have granted him a position of honor with us, and a beautiful abode.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[38:26] O David, we have made you a ruler on earth. Therefore, you shall judge among the people equitably, and do not follow your personal opinion, lest it diverts you from the way of GOD. Surely, those who stray off the way of GOD incur severe retribution for forgetting the Day of Reckoning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[38:27] We did not create the heaven and the earth, and everything between them, in vain. Such is the thinking of those who disbelieve. Therefore, woe to those who disbelieve; they will suffer in Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[38:28] Shall we treat those who believe and lead a righteous life as we treat those who commit evil on earth? Shall we treat the righteous as we treat the wicked?
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[38:29] This is a scripture that we sent down to you, that is sacred - perhaps they reflect on its verses. Those who possess intelligence will take heed.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon's Exemplary Devotion</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="30">[38:30] To David we granted Solomon; a good and obedient servant.
</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[38:59] "This is a group to be thrown into Hell with you." They will not be welcomed (by the residents of Hell). They have deserved to burn in the hellfire.

<P><A NAME="73">[38:73] The angels fell prostrate, all of them,
