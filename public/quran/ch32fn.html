<p class="footnote"><A NAME="13">*32:13 The majority of humans ``insist'' upon going to Hell, by choosing to ignore God's invitations to redeem them. God will not put a single person in Hell. Those who fail to redeem themselves by denouncing idolatry and devoting themselves to God ALONE, and fail to develop their souls through the practices prescribed by our Creator, will have to run to Hell on their own volition. They will be too weak to stand the physical presence of God's energy.</P>
