<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*9:1 The absence of Basmalah from this sura is not only a profound sign from the Almighty Author of the Quran that this sura has been tampered with, but also represents an awsome miracle in its own right. See the details in Appendices 24 & 29. *9:1 & *9:127 This is the only sura that is not prefixed with the Basmalah. This phenomenon has puzzled the students of the Quran for 14 centuries, and many theories were advanced to explain it. Now we realize that the conspicuous absence of the Basmalah serves three purposes: (1) It represents an advance divine proclamation that the idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Quran by adding 2 false verses (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#128">9:128</a>-129). (2) It demonstrates one of the functions of God's mathematical code in the Quran, namely, to guard the Quran against any alteration. (3) It provides additional miraculous features of the Quran's code. Due to their extraordinary importance, the details are given in Appendices 24 and 29. One immediate observation is that the number of occurrences of the word "God" at the end of Sura 9 is 1273 (19x67).  If the two false verses 128 & 129 are included, this phenomenon - and many more - will vanish.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="24">*9:24 Since the odds are overwhelming against any human being to actually believe and devote the worship to God alone (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch12.html#103">12:103</a>, 106), it is virtually impossible to see a whole family believe. Thus, most believers have been faced with the choice: "Either me or God and His messenger." This choice is consistently stated by spouses of the believers, or their parents, their children, etc. Consistently, the believers made the right choice. This is a mandatory test for all believers (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch29.html#2">29:2</a>). <BR>

**9:24 The Quranic, mathematical evidence points specifically at God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (24), we get 505+725+24=1254=19x66.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="31">*9:31 If you consult the "Muslim scholars" about worshiping God alone, and upholding the word of God alone, as taught in this proven scripture, they will advise you against it. If you consult the Pope about the identity of Jesus, he will advise you to uphold a trinity. If you obey the "Muslim scholars" whose advice is contrary to God's teachings, or if you take the Pope's advice instead of God's, you have set up these religious leaders as gods instead of God.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="33">*9:33 This statement, letter for letter, occurs here and in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a>. If we write down the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), followed by the value of "Khalifa" (725), followed by the sura and verse numbers where this statement occurs (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#33">9:33</a> & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a>), we get 505 725 9 33 61 9, a multiple of 19. This confirms that the messenger here is Rashad Khalifa. Additionally, the number of verses from <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#33">9:33</a> to <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a> (3902)+9+33+61+9+the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230) gives 5244, also a multiple of 19. The gematrical value of <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#33">9:33</a> & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a>, calculated by adding the values of every letter, is 7858. By adding this number, plus the number of letters in the two verses (120), plus the number of verses from <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#33">9:33</a> to <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch61.html#9">61:9</a> (3902), plus the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), we get 7858+120+3902+1230=13110=19x690. See Appendices 1, 2, and 26.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="36">*9:36 The word ``month'' is mentioned in the Quran 12 times, and ``day'' 365 times.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="37">*9:37 The Sacred Months according to the corrupted Muslim World are Rajab, Zul-Qe`dah, Zul-Hijjah, and Muharram (7th, 11th, 12th and 1st months of the Islamic Calendar). A careful study of the Quran, however, reveals that they should be Zul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and Rabi I (12th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months). See Appendix 15.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="54">*9:54 This is another proof that the Contact Prayers (Salat) existed before the Quran, and were handed down from Abraham (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch21.html#73">21:73</a>). Also, it stumps those who challenge God's assertion that the Quran is complete and fully detailed when they ask, ``Where can we find the details of the Contact Prayers in the Quran'' (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#19">6:19</a>, 38, 114).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="80">*9:80 If Muhammad could not intercede on behalf of his own uncles and cousins, what makes strangers who never met him think that he will intercede on their behalf? Abraham could not intercede on behalf of his father, nor could Noah intercede on behalf of his son (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch11.html#46">11:46</a> & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch60.html#4">60:4</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="101">*9:101 The hypocrites sit among the believers, listen to the message and proofs, then spread their poisonous doubts. It is a Quranic law that they receive double the retribution, now and forever.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="107">*9:107 Any masjid where the practices are not devoted absolutely to God ALONE belongs to Satan, not God. For example, mentioning the names of Abraham, Muhammad, and/or Ali in the Azan and/or the Salat prayers violates God's commandments in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#136">2:136</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#285">2:285</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#84">3:84</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch72.html#18">72:18</a>. Unfortunately, this is a common idolatrous practice throughout the corrupted Muslim world.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="127">*9:1 & *9:127 This is the only sura that is not prefixed with the Basmalah. This phenomenon has puzzled the students of the Quran for 14 centuries, and many theories were advanced to explain it. Now we realize that the conspicuous absence of the Basmalah serves three purposes: (1) It represents an advance divine proclamation that the idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Quran by adding 2 false verses (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#128">9:128</a>-129).
