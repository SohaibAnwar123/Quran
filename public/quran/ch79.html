</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[79:1] The (angels who) snatch (the souls of the disbelievers) forcibly.
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[79:2] And those who gently take (the souls of the believers) joyfully.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[79:3] And those floating everywhere.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[79:4] Eagerly racing with one another -
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[79:5] to carry out various commands.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[79:6] The day the quake quakes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[79:7] Followed by the second blow.
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[79:8] Certain minds will be terrified.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[79:9] Their eyes will be subdued.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[79:10] They will say, "We have been recreated from the grave!
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[79:11] "How did this happen after we had turned into rotten bones?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[79:12] They had said, "This is an impossible recurrence."
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[79:13] All it takes is one nudge.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[79:14] Whereupon they get up.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[79:15] Have you known about the history of Moses?
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[79:16] His Lord called him at the holy valley of Tuwaa.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[79:17] "Go to Pharaoh; he has transgressed."
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[79:18] Tell him, "Would you not reform?
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[79:19] "Let me guide you to your Lord, that you may turn reverent."
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[79:20] He then showed him the great miracle.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[79:21] But he disbelieved and rebelled.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[79:22] Then he turned away in a hurry.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[79:23] He summoned and proclaimed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[79:24] He said, "I am your Lord; most high."
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[79:25] Consequently, GOD committed him to the retribution in the Hereafter, as well as in the first life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[79:26] This is a lesson for the reverent.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[79:27] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven? He constructed it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[79:28] He raised its masses, and perfected it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[79:29] He made its night dark, and brightened its morn.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[79:30] He made the earth egg-shaped.*

</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[79:31] From it, He produced its own water and pasture.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[79:32] He established the mountains.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[79:33] All this to provide life support for you and your animals.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[79:34] Then, when the great blow comes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[79:35] That is the day when the human will remember everything he did.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[79:36] Hell will be brought into existence.
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[79:37] As for the one who transgressed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[79:38] Who was preoccupied with this life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[79:39] Hell will be the abode.
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[79:40] As for the one who reverenced the majesty of his Lord, and enjoined the self from sinful lusts.
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[79:41] Paradise will be the abode.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[79:42] They ask you about the Hour, and when it will take place!
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[79:43] It is not you (Muhammad) who is destined to announce its time.
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[79:44] Your Lord decides its fate.
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[79:45] Your mission is to warn those who expect it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="46">[79:46] The day they see it, they will feel as if they lasted one evening or half a day.
