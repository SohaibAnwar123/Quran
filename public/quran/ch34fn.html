<p class="footnote"><A NAME="21">*34:21 The criteria that inform us whether or not we believe in the Hereafter are in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#113">6:113</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch17.html#45">17:45</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch39.html#45">39:45</a>. These three criteria bring out our true convictions, regardless of our oral statements.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="28">*34:28 As detailed in Appendix 2, the name of this messenger is mathematically coded into the Quran as ``Rashad Khalifa.'' By adding the numerical value of the name ``Rashad'' (505), plus the numerical value of the name ``Khalifa'' (725), plus the number of the sura (34), plus the number of the verse (28), we obtain a total that conforms with the Quran's 19-based mathematical miracle, which was unveiled through Rashad Khalifa. (505+725+34+28=1292=19x68). More information is given in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#19">5:19</a> and its footnote.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="43">*34:43 By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus this verse number (43), we get 505+725+43=1273=19x67. See Appendices 1 & 2.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="45">*34:45 The great miracles given to Moses and Jesus were limited in time and place; they were witnessed by a few people who happened to exist in that place at that time. But the mathematical miracle of the Quran is perpetual (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#30">74:30</a>-35 and Appendix 1).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="46">*34:46 By placing the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505) next to the value of "Khalifa" (725), then the sura number (34), and the verse number (46), we get 5057253446=19x266171234.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="53">*34:53 People of all religions tend to forsake the word of God and uphold the words of men. The Jews and the Muslims uphold the Mishnah (Hadith) and Gemarrah (Sunna), while the Christians uphold a trinity invented by the Nicene Conference, 325 years after Jesus.</P>
