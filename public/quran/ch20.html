<P><A NAME="40">[20:40] "Your sister walked to them and said, `I can tell you about a nursing mother who can take good care of him.' We thus returned you to your mother, that she may be happy and stop worrying. And when you killed a person, we saved you from the grievous consequences; indeed we tested you thoroughly. You stayed years with the people of Midyan, and now you have come back in accordance with a precise plan.

<P><A NAME="55">[20:55] From it we created you, into it we return you, and from it we bring you out once more.
</P>
<P><A NAME="56">[20:56] We showed him all our proofs, but he disbelieved and refused.
</P>
<P><A NAME="57">[20:57] He said, "Did you come here to take us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?
</P>
<P><A NAME="58">[20:58] "We will surely show you similar magic. Therefore, set an appointment that neither we, nor you will violate; in a neutral place."
</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[20:59] He said, "Your appointed time shall be the day of festivities. Let us all meet in the forenoon."
</P>
<P><A NAME="60">[20:60] Pharaoh summoned his forces, then came.
</P>
<P><A NAME="61">[20:61] Moses said to them, "Woe to you. Do you fabricate lies to fight GOD and thus incur His retribution? Such fabricators will surely fail."
</P>
<P><A NAME="62">[20:62] They disputed among themselves, as they conferred privately.
</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[20:63] They said, "These two are no more than magicians who wish to take you out of your land with their magic, and to destroy your ideal way of life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="64">[20:64] "Let us agree upon one scheme and face them as a united front. The winner today will have the upper hand."
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[20:65] They said, "O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw."
</P>
<P><A NAME="66">[20:66] He said, "You throw." Whereupon, their ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of their magic, as if they were moving.
</P>
<P><A NAME="67">[20:67] Moses harbored some fear.
</P>
<P><A NAME="68">[20:68] We said, "Have no fear. You will prevail.
</P>
<P><A NAME="69">[20:69] "Throw what you hold in your right hand, and it will swallow what they fabricated. What they fabricated is no more than the scheming of a magician. The magician's work will not succeed."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Experts Recognize The Truth</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="70">[20:70] The magicians fell prostrate, saying, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
</P>
<P><A NAME="71">[20:71] He said, "Did you believe in him without my permission? He must be your chief; the one who taught you magic. I will surely sever your hands and feet on alternate sides. I will crucify you on the palm trunks. You will find out which of us can inflict the worst retribution, and who outlasts whom."
</P>
<P><A NAME="72">[20:72] They said, "We will not prefer you over the clear proofs that came to us, and over the One who created us. Therefore, issue whatever judgment you wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[20:73] "We have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins, and the magic that you forced us to perform. GOD is far better and Everlasting."
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[20:74] Anyone who comes to his Lord guilty will incur Hell, wherein he never dies, nor stays alive.
</P>
<P><A NAME="75">[20:75] As for those who come to Him as believers who had led a righteous life, they attain the high ranks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[20:76] The gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, will be their abode forever. Such is the reward for those who purify themselves.
</P>
<P><A NAME="77">[20:77] We inspired Moses: "Lead My servants out, and strike for them a dry road across the sea. You shall not fear that you may get caught, nor shall you worry."
</P>
<P><A NAME="78">[20:78] Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but the sea overwhelmed them, as it was destined to overwhelm them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="79">[20:79] Thus, Pharaoh misled his people; he did not guide them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="80">[20:80] O Children of Israel, we delivered you from your enemy, summoned you to the right side of Mount Sinai, and we sent down to you manna and quails.
</P>
<P><A NAME="81">[20:81] Eat from the good things we provided for you, and do not transgress, lest you incur My wrath. Whoever incurs My wrath has fallen.

</P>
<P><A NAME="85">[20:85] He said, "We have put your people to the test after you left, but the Samarian misled them."
</P>
<P><A NAME="86">[20:86] Moses returned to his people, angry and disappointed, saying, "O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Could you not wait? Did you want to incur wrath from your Lord? Is this why you broke your agreement with me?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="87">[20:87] They said, "We did not break our agreement with you on purpose. But we were loaded down with jewelry, and decided to throw our loads in. This is what the Samarian suggested."
</P>
<P><A NAME="88">[20:88] He produced for them a sculpted calf, complete with a calf's sound.* They said, "This is your god, and the god of Moses." Thus, he forgot.

<P><A NAME="89">[20:89] Could they not see that it neither responded to them, nor possessed any power to harm them, or benefit them?

</P>
<P><A NAME="91">[20:91] They said, "We will continue to worship it, until Moses comes back."

</P>
<P><A NAME="94">[20:94] He said, "O son of my mother; do not pull me by my beard and my head. I was afraid that you might say, `You have divided the Children of Israel, and disobeyed my orders.' "
</P>
<P><A NAME="95">[20:95] He said, "What is the matter with you, O Samarian?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="96">[20:96] He said, "I saw what they could not see. I grabbed a fistful (of dust) from the place where the messenger stood, and used it (to mix into the golden calf). This is what my mind inspired me to do."*

<P><A NAME="97">[20:97] He said, "Then go, and, throughout your life, do not even come close. You have an appointed time (for your final judgment) that you can never evade. Look at your god that you used to worship; we will burn it and throw it into the sea, to stay down there forever."

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You Have But One God</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="98">[20:98] Your only god is GOD; the One beside whom there is no other god. His knowledge encompasses all things.

</P>
<P><A NAME="100">[20:100] Those who disregard it will bear a load (of sins) on the Day of Resurrection.
</P>
<P><A NAME="101">[20:101] Eternally they abide therein; what a miserable load on the Day of Resurrection!

<P><A NAME="102">[20:102] That is the day when the horn is blown, and we summon the guilty on that day blue.
</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="104">[20:104] We are fully aware of their utterances. The most accurate among them will say, "You stayed no more than a day."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Day of Resurrection</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="112">[20:112] As for those who worked righteousness, while believing, they will have no fear of injustice or adversity.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="115">[20:115] We tested Adam in the past, but he forgot, and we found him indecisive.

<A TARGET="footnotes" HREF="ch20fn.html#115">Footnote</A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="116">[20:116] Recall that we said to the angels, "Fall prostrate before Adam." They fell prostrate, except Satan; he refused.
</P>
<P><A NAME="117">[20:117] We then said, "O Adam, this is an enemy of you and your wife. Do not let him evict you from Paradise, lest you become miserable.

</P>
<P><A NAME="119">[20:119] "Nor will you thirst therein, nor suffer from any heat."

</P>
<P><A NAME="121">[20:121] They ate from it, whereupon their bodies became visible to them, and they tried to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. Adam thus disobeyed his Lord, and fell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="122">[20:122] Subsequently, his Lord chose him, redeemed him, and guided him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="123">[20:123] He said, "Go down therefrom, all of you. You are enemies of one another. When guidance comes to you from Me, anyone who follows My guidance will not go astray, nor suffer any misery.

<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Disbelievers: Miserable Life Unavoidable</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="124">[20:124] "As for the one who disregards My message, he will have a miserable life, and we resurrect him, on the Day of Resurrection, blind."

<P><A NAME="125">[20:125] He will say, "My Lord, why did you summon me blind, when I used to be a seer?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="126">[20:126] He will say, "Because you forgot our revelations when they came to you, you are now forgotten."
</P>
<P><A NAME="127">[20:127] We thus requite those who transgress and refuse to believe in the revelations of their Lord. The retribution in the Hereafter is far worse and everlasting.
</P>
<P><A NAME="128">[20:128] Does it ever occur to them how many previous generations we have annihilated? They are now walking in the homes of those before them. These are signs for those who possess intelligence.
</P>
<P><A NAME="129">[20:129] If it were not for your Lord's predetermined plan, they would have been judged immediately.
</P>
<P><A NAME="130">[20:130] Therefore, be patient in the face of their utterances, and praise and glorify your Lord before sunrise and before sunset. And during the night glorify Him, as well as at both ends of the day, that you may be happy.
</P>
<P><A NAME="131">[20:131] And do not covet what we bestowed upon any other people. Such are temporary ornaments of this life, whereby we put them to the test. What your Lord provides for you is far better, and everlasting.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="132">[20:132] You shall enjoin your family to observe the contact prayers (Salat), and steadfastly persevere in doing so. We do not ask you for any provisions; we are the ones who provide for you. The ultimate triumph belongs to the righteous.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Messengers?</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="133">[20:133] They said, "If he could only show us a miracle from his Lord!" Did they not receive sufficient miracles with the previous messages?
</P>
<P><A NAME="134">[20:134] Had we annihilated them before this, they would have said, "Our Lord, had You sent a messenger to us, we would have followed Your revelations, and would have avoided this shame and humiliation."
</P>
<P><A NAME="135">[20:135] Say, "All of us are waiting, so wait; you will surely find out who are on the correct path, and who are truly guided."
