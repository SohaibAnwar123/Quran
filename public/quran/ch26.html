<P><A NAME="2">[26:2] These (letters) constitute proofs of this clarifying scripture.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[26:3] You may blame yourself that they are not believers.

<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="5">[26:5] Whenever a reminder from the Most Gracious comes to them, that is new, they turn away in aversion.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[26:6] Since they disbelieved, they have incurred the consequences of their heedlessness.
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[26:7] Have they not seen the earth, and how many kinds of beautiful plants we have grown thereon?
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[26:8] This should be a sufficient proof for them, but most of them are not believers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[26:9] Most assuredly, your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="10">[26:10] Recall that your Lord called Moses: "Go to the transgressing people.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[26:11] "Pharaoh's people; perhaps they reform."
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[26:12] He said, "My Lord, I fear lest they disbelieve me.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[26:13] "I may lose my temper. My tongue gets tied; send for my brother Aaron.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[26:14] "Also, they consider me a fugitive; I fear lest they kill me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[26:15] He said, "No, (they will not). Go with My proofs. We will be with you, listening.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[26:16] "Go to Pharaoh and say, `We are messengers from the Lord of the universe.'
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[26:17] " `Let the Children of Israel go.' "
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[26:18] He said, "Did we not raise you from infancy, and you spent many years with us?
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[26:19] "Then you committed the crime that you committed, and you were ungrateful."
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[26:20] He said, "Indeed, I did it when I was astray.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[26:21] "Then I fled, when I feared you, and my Lord endowed me with wisdom and made me one of the messengers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[26:22] "You are boasting that you did me a favor, while enslaving the Children of Israel!"
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[26:23] Pharaoh said, "What is the Lord of the universe?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[26:24] He said, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them. You should be certain about this."
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[26:25] He said to those around him, "Did you hear this?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[26:26] He said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors."
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[26:27] He said, "Your messenger who is sent to you is crazy."
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[26:28] He said, "The Lord of the east and the west, and everything between them, if you understand."
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[26:29] He said, "If you accept any god, other than me, I will throw you in the prison."
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[26:30] He said, "What if I show you something profound?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[26:31] He said, "Then produce it, if you are truthful."
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[26:32] He then threw his staff, whereupon it became a profound snake.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[26:33] And he took out his hand, and it was white to the beholders.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[26:34] He said to the elders around him, "This is an experienced magician.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[26:35] "He wants to take you out of your land, with his magic. What do you suggest?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[26:36] They said, "Respite him and his brother, and send summoners to every town.
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[26:37] "Let them summon every experienced magician."
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[26:38] The magicians were gathered at the appointed time, on the appointed day.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[26:39] The people were told: "Come one and all; let us gather together here.
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[26:40] "Maybe we will follow the magicians, if they are the winners."
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[26:41] When the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, "Do we get paid, if we are the winners?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[26:42] He said, "Yes indeed; you will even be close to me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[26:43] Moses said to them "Throw what you are going to throw."
</P>
<P><A NAME="44">[26:44] They threw their ropes and sticks, and said, "By Pharaoh's majesty, we will be the victors."
</P>
<P><A NAME="45">[26:45] Moses threw his staff, whereupon it swallowed what they fabricated.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Experts See the Truth</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="46">[26:46] The magicians fell prostrate.
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[26:47] They said, "We believe in the Lord of the universe.
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[26:48] "The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[26:49] He said, "Did you believe with him before I give you permission? He must be your teacher, who taught you magic. You will surely find out. I will sever your hands and feet on alternate sides. I will crucify you all."
</P>
<P><A NAME="50">[26:50] They said, "This will not change our decision; to our Lord we will return.
</P>
<P><A NAME="51">[26:51] "We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, especially that we are the first believers."
</P>
<P><A NAME="52">[26:52] We inspired Moses: "Travel with My servants; you will be pursued."
</P>
<P><A NAME="53">[26:53] Pharaoh sent to the cities callers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="54">[26:54] (Proclaiming,) "This is a small gang.
</P>
<P><A NAME="55">[26:55] "They are now opposing us.
</P>
<P><A NAME="56">[26:56] "Let us all beware of them."
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inevitable Retribution</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="57">[26:57] Consequently, we deprived them of gardens and springs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="58">[26:58] And treasures and an honorable position.
</P>
<P><A NAME="59">[26:59] Then we made it an inheritance for the Children of Israel.
</P>
<P><A NAME="60">[26:60] They pursued them towards the east.
</P>
<P><A NAME="61">[26:61] When both parties saw each other, Moses' people said, "We will be caught."
</P>
<P><A NAME="62">[26:62] He said, "No way. My Lord is with me; He will guide me."
</P>
<P><A NAME="63">[26:63] We then inspired Moses: "Strike the sea with your staff," whereupon it parted. Each part was like a great hill.
</P>
<P><A NAME="64">[26:64] We then delivered them all.
</P>
<P><A NAME="65">[26:65] We thus saved Moses and all those who were with him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="66">[26:66] And we drowned the others.
</P>
<P><A NAME="67">[26:67] This should be a sufficient proof, but most people are not believers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="68">[26:68] Most assuredly, your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.

</P>
<P><A NAME="70">[26:70] He said to his father and his people, "What is this you are worshiping?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="71">[26:71] They said, "We worship statues; we are totally devoted to them."
</P>
<P><A NAME="72">[26:72] He said, "Can they hear you when you implore?
</P>
<P><A NAME="73">[26:73] "Can they benefit you, or harm you?"
</P>
<P><A NAME="74">[26:74] They said, "No; but we found our parents doing this."
</P>
<P><A NAME="75">[26:75] He said, "Do you see these idols that you worship.
</P>
<P><A NAME="76">[26:76] "You and your ancestors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="77">[26:77] "I am against them, for I am devoted only to the Lord of the universe.

</P>
<P><A NAME="83">[26:83] "My Lord, grant me wisdom, and include me with the righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="84">[26:84] "Let the example I set for the future generations be a good one.

<P><A NAME="85">[26:85] "Make me one of the inheritors of the blissful Paradise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="86">[26:86] "And forgive my father, for he has gone astray.
</P>
<P><A NAME="87">[26:87] "And do not forsake me on the Day of Resurrection."
</P>
<P><A NAME="88">[26:88] That is the day when neither money, nor children, can help.
</P>
<P><A NAME="89">[26:89] Only those who come to GOD with their whole heart (will be saved).
</P>
<P><A NAME="90">[26:90] Paradise will be presented to the righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="91">[26:91] Hell will be set up for the strayers.
</P>
<P class="subtitle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They Will Disown Their Idols</P>
<P class="hasSubtitle"><A NAME="92">[26:92] They will be asked, "Where are the idols you had worshiped

</P>
<P><A NAME="94">[26:94] They will be thrown therein, together with the strayers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="95">[26:95] And all of Satan's soldiers.
</P>
<P><A NAME="96">[26:96] They will say as they feud therein,
</P>
<P><A NAME="97">[26:97] "By GOD, we were far astray.
</P>
<P><A NAME="98">[26:98] "How could we set you up to rank with the Lord of the universe?
</P>
<P><A NAME="99">[26:99] "Those who misled us were wicked.
</P>
<P><A NAME="100">[26:100] "Now we have no intercessors.

<P><A NAME="101">[26:101] "Nor a single close friend.
</P>
<P><A NAME="102">[26:102] "If only we could get another chance, we would then believe."
</P>
<P><A NAME="103">[26:103] This should be a good lesson. But most people are not believers.

</P>
<P><A NAME="157">[26:157] They slaughtered her, and thus incurred sorrow.

<P><A NAME="196">[26:196] It has been prophesied in the books of previous generations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="205">[26:205] As you see, we allowed them to enjoy for years.
