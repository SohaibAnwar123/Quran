<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*3:1 See Footnote <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#1">2:1</a> and Appendix One.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="18">*3:18 The proclamation of faith (Shahaadah) that is decreed by God is: "There is no god except God," in Arabic "La Elaaha Ella Allah" (see also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch37.html#35">37:35</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch47.html#19">47:19</a>). The corrupted Muslims insist upon adding a second "Shahaadah" proclaiming that Muhammad is God's messenger. This is by definition "Shirk" (idolatry) and a flagrant defiance of God and His messenger. Additionally, it violates the major commandments in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#136">2:136</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#285">2:285</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#84">3:84</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch4.html#150">4:150</a>-152 prohibiting any distinction among God's messengers. By proclaiming that "Muhammad is a messenger of God," and failing to make the same proclamation for other messengers such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Saleh, and Jonah, a distinction is committed and a major commandment is violated.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="51">*3:51 This is precisely what Jesus is quoted to say throughout the New Testament. See for example the Gospel of John 20:17, and the book "Jesus: Myths and Message" by Lisa Spray, Ch.4 (Universal Unity, Fremont, California, 1992).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="54">*3:54-55 We learn that Jesus' soul, the real person, was raised, i.e., Jesus' life on earth was terminated, prior to the arrest, torture, and crucifixion of his empty, soulless, physiologically living body (See the details in Appendix 22).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="59">*3:59 The "equality" of the creation of Jesus and Adam is confirmed mathematically; Jesus and Adam are mentioned in the Quran the same number of times, 25 times each.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="75">*3:75 Prior to the discovery of the Quran's mathematical code, some scholars falsely claimed that Muhammad was an illiterate man who could not write such a great book. They distorted the meaning of the word "Ummy," claiming that it meant "illiterate." This verse proves that "Ummiyyeen" means "gentiles" (See also <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch62.html#2">62:2</a> & Appendix 28).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="81">*3:81 This major prophecy has now been fulfilled. God's Messenger of the Covenant, as prophesied in this verse and in the Bible's Malachi 3:1-21, Luke 17:22-36 & Matthew 24:27, is to purify and unify God's messages which were delivered by God's prophets. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. have been severely corrupted. It is the will of Almighty God to purify them and unify them under the banner of worshiping Him alone. Overwhelming evidence has been provided by God in support of His Messenger of the Covenant, whose name is incontrovertibly specified in the Quran's mathematical code as "Rashad Khalifa." For example, adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (81) gives 1311, or 19x69 (see Appendix 2 for the detailed evidence).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="86">*3:86 Verses <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#82">3:82</a>-90 inform us that those who reject God's Messenger of the Covenant are no longer submitters (Muslims), since they no longer believe the Quran. The proofs mentioned in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#86">3:86</a> refer to the Quran's mathematical code, which was revealed through God's Messenger of the Covenant. Both <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#86">3:86</a> and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#90">3:90</a> talk about "disbelieving after believing."</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="96">*3:96 This is an M-initialed sura, and this peculiar spelling of "Mecca" as "Becca" causes the occurence of "M" to conform to the Quran's mathematical code. The normal spelling "Mecca" would have increased the frequency of occurence of "M" (Appendix 1).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="125">*3:124-125 Thirty different numbers are mentioned in the Quran. Their total comes to 162146, 19x8534. This conforms with the Quran's mathematical miracle (See Appendix One).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="130">*3:130 Interest on bank deposits and interest charged on loans are lawful if they are not excessive (5-15%). Banks invest and their profits are passed on to the depositors. Since all parties are happy and no one is victimized, it is perfectly lawful to take interest from the bank (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#275">2:275</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="159">*3:159 The currency of the U.S.A. is the only currency that carries the phrase: "In God we trust." It is a fact that the American dollar has been the strongest currency in the world, and the standard by which all other currencies are measured.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="169">*3:169 We learn from the Quran that the righteous do not really die; they simply leave their worldly bodies and go directly to the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#154">2:154</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch8.html#24">8:24</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#32">16:32</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch22.html#58">22:58</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch44.html#56">44:56</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch36.html#26">36:26</a>-27; see also Appendix 17).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="179"><a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#179">3:179</a> The end of the world is one example of future events revealed to God's Messenger of the Covenant. See Footnote <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch72.html#27">72:27</a>.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="186">*3:186 After passing the admission tests, the proven worshipers of God ALONE enjoy a perfect life, now and forever. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch29.html#2">29:2</a>-3, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch10.html#62">10:62</a>, and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch24.html#55">24:55</a>.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="191">*3:191 Your god is whoever or whatever occupies your mind most of the time. The true believers are those who remember God most of the time. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch23.html#84">23:84</a>-89 and Appendix 27.</P>
