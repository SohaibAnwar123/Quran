<p class="footnote"><A NAME="11">*24:11 This refers to a historical incident where the Prophet Muhammad's wife Aysha was left in the desert by mistake, and later found by a young man who helped her catch up with the Prophet's caravan. This triggered the famous `Big Lie' against Aysha.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="30">*24:30-31 Dressing modestly, therefore, is a trait of the believing men and women. The minimum requirements for a woman's dress is to lengthen her garment (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch33.html#59">33:59</a>) and to cover her chest. Tyrannical Arab traditions have given a false impression that a woman must be covered from head to toe; such is not a Quranic or Islamic dress.</P>
