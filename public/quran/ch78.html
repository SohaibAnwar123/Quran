</P>
<P><A NAME="1">[78:1] What are they questioning?
</P>
<P><A NAME="2">[78:2] The great event.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3">[78:3] That is disputed by them.
</P>
<P><A NAME="4">[78:4] Indeed, they will find out.
</P>
<P><A NAME="5">[78:5] Most assuredly, they will find out.
</P>
<P><A NAME="6">[78:6] Did we not make the earth habitable?
</P>
<P><A NAME="7">[78:7] And the mountains stabilizers?
</P>
<P><A NAME="8">[78:8] We created you as mates (for one another).
</P>
<P><A NAME="9">[78:9] We created sleeping so you can rest.
</P>
<P><A NAME="10">[78:10] We made the night a cover.
</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[78:11] And the day to seek provisions.
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[78:12] We built above you seven universes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="13">[78:13] We created a bright lamp.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[78:14] We send down from the clouds pouring water.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[78:15] To produce with it grains and plants.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[78:16] And various orchards.
</P>
<P><A NAME="17">[78:17] The Day of Decision is appointed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="18">[78:18] The day the horn is blown, and you come in throngs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="19">[78:19] The heaven will be opened like gates.
</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[78:20] The mountains will be removed, as if they were a mirage.
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[78:21] Gehenna is inevitable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[78:22] For the transgressors; it will be their abode.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[78:23] They stay in it for ages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[78:24] They never taste in it coolness, nor a drink.
</P>
<P><A NAME="25">[78:25] Only an inferno, and bitter food.
</P>
<P><A NAME="26">[78:26] A just requital.
</P>
<P><A NAME="27">[78:27] They never expected to be held accountable.
</P>
<P><A NAME="28">[78:28] And utterly rejected our signs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="29">[78:29] We counted everything in a record.
</P>
<P><A NAME="30">[78:30] Suffer the consequences; we will only increase your retribution.
</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[78:31] The righteous have deserved a reward.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[78:32] Orchards and grapes.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[78:33] Magnificent spouses.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[78:34] Delicious drinks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[78:35] They will never hear in it any nonsense or lies.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[78:36] A reward from your Lord; a generous recompense.
</P>
<P><A NAME="37">[78:37] Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them. The Most Gracious. No one can abrogate His decisions.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[78:38] The day will come when the Spirit and the angels will stand in a row. None will speak except those permitted by the Most Gracious, and they will utter only what is right.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[78:39] Such is the inevitable day. Whoever wills let him take refuge in his Lord.
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[78:40] We have sufficiently warned you about an imminent retribution. That is the day when everyone will examine what his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever will say, "Oh, I wish I were dust."
