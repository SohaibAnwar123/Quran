<P><A NAME="9">[69:9] Pharaoh, others before him, and the sinners (of Sodom) were wicked.

</P>
<P><A NAME="11">[69:11] The flood was devastating, so we carried you on the floating (ark).
</P>
<P><A NAME="12">[69:12] We rendered it a lesson for you, that any listening ear may understand.

<P><A NAME="13">[69:13] When the horn is blown once.
</P>
<P><A NAME="14">[69:14] The earth and the mountains will be carried off and crushed; utterly crushed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="15">[69:15] That is the day when the inevitable event will come to pass.
</P>
<P><A NAME="16">[69:16] The heaven will crack, and fall apart.

</P>
<P><A NAME="20">[69:20] "I did believe that I was going to be held accountable."
</P>
<P><A NAME="21">[69:21] He has deserved a happy life.
</P>
<P><A NAME="22">[69:22] In an exalted Paradise.
</P>
<P><A NAME="23">[69:23] Its fruits are within reach.
</P>
<P><A NAME="24">[69:24] Eat and drink happily in return for your works in days past.

</P>
<P><A NAME="31">[69:31] Burn him in Hell.
</P>
<P><A NAME="32">[69:32] In a chain that is seventy arms long, tie him up.
</P>
<P><A NAME="33">[69:33] For he did not believe in GOD, Most Great.
</P>
<P><A NAME="34">[69:34] Nor did he advocate the feeding of the poor.
</P>
<P><A NAME="35">[69:35] Consequently, he has no friend here.
</P>
<P><A NAME="36">[69:36] Nor any food, except the bitter variety.

<P><A NAME="37">[69:37] Food for the sinners.
</P>
<P><A NAME="38">[69:38] I swear by what you see.
</P>
<P><A NAME="39">[69:39] And what you do not see.
</P>
<P><A NAME="40">[69:40] This is the utterance of an honorable messenger.
</P>
<P><A NAME="41">[69:41] Not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe.
</P>
<P><A NAME="42">[69:42] Nor the utterance of a soothsayer; rarely do you take heed.
</P>
<P><A NAME="43">[69:43] A revelation from the Lord of the universe.
</P>

<P><A NAME="46">[69:46] We would have stopped the revelations to him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="47">[69:47] None of you could have helped him.
</P>
<P><A NAME="48">[69:48] This is a reminder for the righteous.
</P>
<P><A NAME="49">[69:49] We know; some of you are rejectors.
</P>
<P><A NAME="50">[69:50] It is but sorrow for the disbelievers.
