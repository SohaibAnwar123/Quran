<p class="footnote"><A NAME="2">*5:2 Hunting and the cutting of plants are forbidden during pilgrimage for the conservation of natural resources. With thousands of pilgrims converging on Mecca, if hunting were permitted, the land would quickly be stripped of its natural resources. Animal offerings are made part of the pilgrimage to provide for the converging pilgrims, as well as the local population, and to replenish any depleted supplies. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch2.html#196">2:196</a>.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="3">*5:3 The ``meat'' of the pig is prohibited, not the ``fat.'' Anything that is not specifically prohibited in the Quran must be considered lawful. See <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch6.html#145">6:145</a>-146.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="12">*5:12 If you fulfill the requirements stated in this verse, God will let you know that He is with you; you will have no doubt about it. Prominent among God's signs are mathematical signs for those who understand the Quran's miracle (Appendix One).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="19">*5:19 This verse reports the fulfillment of the biblical and Quranic prophecy regarding the advent of God's Messenger of the Covenent (Malachi 3:1, Quran <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch3.html#81">3:81</a>). The name of this messenger is mathematically coded into the Quran as "Rashad Khalifa." This very special verse warrants the presentation of specific evidence. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the sura number (5), plus the verse number (19), we obtain a total of 505+725+5+19 = 1254, or 19x66. Nineteen is the Quran's common denominator, which was revealed through Rashad Khalifa. More evidence and specific details are in Appendix Two.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="27">*5:27-31 The names of the two sons involved in this first murder are not relevant. But they are given in the Bible as Abel and Cain (Genesis 4:2-9).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="38">*5:38 The practice of cutting off the thief's hand, as decreed by the false Muslims, is a satanic practice without Quranic basis. Due to the special importance of this example, God has provided mathematical proof in support of marking the hand of the thief, rather than severing it. Verse <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch12.html#31">12:31</a> refers to the women who so admired Joseph that they ``cut'' their hands. Obviously, they did not ``cut off'' their hands; nobody can. The sum of sura and verse numbers are the same for <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#38">5:38</a> and <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch12.html#31">12:31</a>, i.e., 43. It is also the will and mercy of God that this mathematical relationship conforms with the Quran's 19-based code. Nineteen verses after <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch12.html#31">12:31</a>, we see the same word (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch12.html#50">12:50</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="44"><a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#44">5:44</a> The Torah is a collection of all the scriptures revealed through all the prophets of Israel prior to Jesus Christ, i.e., today's Old Testament. Nowhere in the Quran do we find that the Torah was given to Moses.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="51">*5:51 Relations with other people are governed by the basic rule in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#57">5:57</a> & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch60.html#8">60:8</a>-9. The Jews and Christians who cannot be friends are specifically mentioned in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch5.html#57">5:57</a>; they are the ones who mock and ridicule the believers, or attack them.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="72">*5:72-76 In John 20:17, we see that Jesus taught that he was neither God, nor the son of God. Many theologians have concluded, after careful research, that today's Christianity is not the same Christianity taught by Jesus. Two outstanding books on this subject are ``The Myth of God Incarnate'' (The Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1977) and The ``Mythmaker'' (Harper & Row, New York, 1986). On the front jacket of ``The Mythmaker'' we read the following statement: "...Hyam Maccoby presents new arguments to support the view that Paul, not Jesus, was the founder of Christianity....it was Paul alone who created a new religion through his vision of Jesus as a divine Saviour who died to save humanity."</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="97">*5:97 The idol-worshiping Muslims have instituted two ``Sacred Masjids'' by consecrating the Prophet's tomb. The Quran talks only about one Sacred Masjid.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="114">*5:114-115 The Quran's overwhelming miracle (Appendix One) is described in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#35">74:35</a> as ``One of the greatest miracles,'' and brings with it an uncommonly great responsibility.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="115">*5:114-115 The Quran's overwhelming miracle (Appendix One) is described in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#35">74:35</a> as "One of the greatest miracles," and brings with it an uncommonly great responsibility.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="116">*5:116 It is noteworthy that the Quran consistently calls Jesus "son of Mary" and the Bible calls him "son of man". God knew that some will blaspheme and call him "son of God"!</P>
