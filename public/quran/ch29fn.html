<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*29:1 See Appendix 1 for details of the Quran's mathematical composition, and the meaning of these previously mysterious Quranic Initials.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="14">*29:14 Since the Quran's miracle is mathematical, the numbers especially constitute an important part of the 19-based code. Thus, the numbers mentioned in the Quran add up to 162146, or 19x8534 (see Appendix 1 for the details).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="19">*29:19-20 We learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely guided process. See Appendix 31 for the details.</P>

<p class="footnote"><A NAME="41">*29:41-43 It takes a knowledgeable person to know that the Black Widow spider kills her mate. The use of the feminine reference to the spider in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch29.html#41">29:41</a> is thus significant. This is in addition to the fact that the spider web is physically very flimsy.</P>

<p class="footnote"><A NAME="45">*29:45 Your god is whatever occupies your mind most of the time (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch20.html#14">20:14</a> & Appendix 27).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="48">*29:48-51 It was the will of the Most Wise to separate the Quran from its awesome mathematical miracle by 1400 years. Seeing how the Muslims en masse have idolized Muhammad, it is obvious that if the Quran's mathematical miracle were also revealed through Muhammed, many people would have worshiped him as God incarnate. As it is, God willed that the great miracle of the Quran (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch74.html#30">74:30</a>-35) shall await the computer age, and to have it revealed through His Messenger of the Covenant (see Appendices 1, 2, & 26).</P>

<p class="footnote"><A NAME="53">*29:53 Anyone who dies before the age of 40 goes to Heaven, and not everyone deserves this. People sometimes lament the slowness of justice when a vicious criminal is not executed promptly. God knows who deserves Heaven (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#15">46:15</a> and Appendix 32).</P>
