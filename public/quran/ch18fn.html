<p class="footnote"><A NAME="9">*18:8-9 As it turns out, the history of these Christian believers, the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, is directly connected with the end of the world as stated in <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#9">18:9</a> & 21. The role of these believers in unveiling the end of the world is detailed in Appendix 25.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="16">*18:16-20 Ephesus is located about 200 miles south of ancient Nicene, and 30 miles south of today's Izmir in Turkey. The dwellers of the cave were young Christians who wanted to follow the teachings of Jesus, and worship God alone. They were fleeing the persecution of neo-christians who proclaimed a corrupted Christianity three centuries after Jesus, following the Nicene Conferences, when the Trinity doctrine was announced. In 1928, Franz Miltner, an Austrian archeologist discovered the tomb of the seven sleepers of Ephesus. Their history is well documented in several encyclopedias.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="17">*18:17 This sign, or hint, tells us that the cave was facing north.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="21">*18:21 As detailed in Appendix 25, this story helped pinpoint the end of the world.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="24">*18:24 This important commandment gives us daily opportunities to remember God.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="25">*18:25 The difference between 300 solar years and 300 lunar years is nine years. Thus, discovering the end of the world was predetermined by the Almighty to take place in AD 1980 (1400 AH), 300 years (309 lunar years) before the end of the world (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch72.html#27">72:27</a> and Appendix 25).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="32">*18:32-42 The Quran cites many examples of the different gods that people worship beside God; they include children (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch7.html#190">7:190</a>), religious leaders and scholars (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch9.html#31">9:31</a>), property (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch18.html#42">18:42</a>), dead saints and prophets (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch16.html#20">16:20</a>-21, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch35.html#14">35:14</a>, & <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch46.html#5">46:5</a>-6), and the ego (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch25.html#43">25:43</a>, <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch45.html#23">45:23</a>).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="50">*18:50 When the great feud in the heavenly society took place (<a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch38.html#69">38:69</a>), all creatures became classified into angels, jinns, and humans (Appendix 7).</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="51">*18:51 God knew that Satan and his supporters (jinns and humans) were going to make the wrong decision. Hence their exclusion from witnessing the creation process.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="80">*18:80 Adolf Hitler was a cute and seemingly innocent child. Had he died as a child, many would have grieved, and many would have even questioned God's wisdom. We learn from these profound lessons that there is a good reason behind everything.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="94">*18:94-98 One of my duties as God's Messenger of the Covenant is to state that Gog and Magog, the final sign before the end of the world, will reappear in 2270 AD (1700 AH), just 10 years before the end. Note that Gog and Magog occur in Suras 18 and 21, precisely 17 verses before the end of each sura, representing 17 lunar centuries (see <a TARGET="suras" HREF="ch72.html#27">72:27</a> and Appendix 25).</P>
