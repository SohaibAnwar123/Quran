<p class="footnote"><A NAME="12">*35:12-13 When we send our astronauts into space, we provide them with their minimum needs of food, water, and oxygen. When we sided with Satan's blasphemy billions of years ago (Appendix 7), God launched us into space aboard the spaceship Earth. But God has supplied our spaceship with awesome renewable systems that provide a great variety of fresh foods, water, oxygen, and even the reproduction of us astronauts.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="14">*35:14 People idolize Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, Ali, and/or the saints; such idols are unaware and utterly powerless. Even when they were alive on this earth, they were powerless.</P>
<p class="footnote"><A NAME="24">*35:24 The gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), plus the verse number (24) give us a total that is a multiple of 19 (1230+24=1254=19x66).</P>
