<p class="footnote"><A NAME="1">*1:1 The first verse in the Quran represents the foundation upon which a superhuman 19-based mathematical miracle is built. This important statement consists of 19 Arabic letters, and every word in it occurs in the whole Quran in multiples of 19 (see Appendices 1 & 29 for the details).<BR><BR><BR>*1:1-7 Sura 1 is God's gift to us to establish contact with Him through the daily Contact Prayers. This fact is supported by an earth-shattering, simple-to-understand-but-impossible-to-imitate mathematical composition that challenges the greatest mathematicians on earth, and stumps them; it is far beyond human capabilities:<BR><BR>(1) The sura number, followed by the numbers of verses, next to each other, give 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. This number is a multiple of 19.<BR><BR>(2) If we substitute the number of letters per verse in place of the verse numbers, we get 1 19 17 12 11 19 18 43. This number is also a multiple of 19.<BR><BR>(3) If we insert the total gematrical value of every verse, we get 1 19 786 17 581 12 618 11 241 19 836 18 1072 43 6009. This number is a multiple of 19.<BR><BR><PRE>Verse No.	No. of Letters	Gematrical Value<BR>=========	===========	==============<BR>1		19		786<BR>2		17		581<BR>3		12		618<BR>4		11		241<BR>5		19		836<BR>6		18		1072<BR>7		43		6009<BR><BR>Totals		139		10143</PRE><BR><BR>(4) The number shown above includes all parameters of Sura 1 and consists of 38 digits (19x2).<BR><BR>(5) It is noteworthy that this 38-digit number is still divisible by 19 when we write its components backward, from right to left, as practiced by the Arabs. Thus, 6009 43 1072 18 836 19 241 11 618 12 581 17 786 19 1 is also a multiple of 19.<BR><BR>(6) The mathematical representations mentioned above participate in numerous extraordinary mathematical phenomena to confirm all details of the five daily Contact Prayers (Appendix 15).<BR><BR>(7) Many more astounding phenomena are given in Appendix One. Thus, the reader is handed, at the outset, tangible proof that this is God's message to the world.</P>
