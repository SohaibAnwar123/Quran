              Abraham: Original Source of the Contact Prayers
            </h4>
            <p>
              The Quran teaches us in many suras that Submission (in Arabic,
              "Islam") is the religion of Abraham (please consult 2:135, 3:95,
              4:125, 6:161 and 22:78). Muhammad was a follower of Abraham, as we
              learn from 16:123. All religious practices in Submission (Islam)
              were given to us through Abraham; they include:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal ms-5">
              <li> the five daily Contact Prayers (Salat),</li>
              <li>the obligatory charity (Zakat),</li>
              <li>the fasting during Ramadan, and</li>
              <li>the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Specifically, we learn from the Quran (21:73) that the Contact
              Prayers (Salat) and the obligatory charity (Zakat) were given to
              Abraham.
              <br />
              Numerous verses throughout the Quran inform us that the Contact
              Prayers were in existence, intact, and practiced before the advent
              of Muhammad (see for example 8:35 & 9:54).
              <br />
              All positions of the Contact Prayers are found in the Quran,
              including the standing position (3:39, 39:9) and bowing (Rukooâ€™)
              and prostrating (Sujood) positions (2:43, 3:43, 9:112, 22:26 &
              77).

            <p className="text-black">
              Azaan is not a part of the Contact Prayers, nor is it required.
              But it has become a tradition in the Muslim communities to summon
              the people to prayer through a loud announcement. The original
              Azaan used to conform with the Quran's teachings, and became
              corrupted with time. Originally, the call to prayer consisted of:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal ms-5">
              <li>Allahu Akbar (God is Great), 4 times.</li>
              <li>
                Laa Elaaha Ellah Allah (There is no other god beside God), once.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Many years later, some people added Muhammad's name to the Azaan.
              This violates God's commandments in 2:136, 2:285, 3:84, 4:150 and
              72:18. Later, other groups of Muslims added the names of Ali and
              his family. Today, the Azaan is severely corrupted throughout the
              Muslim world, and constitutes idol worship, not Submission to God
              ALONE.

            usually observed when a group of people are ready to observe the
            prayer. One person stands up and utters the Azaan words, or chants
            them as follows:

            <p>
              This Contact Prayer consists of 2 units. thus, when you get up
              from the second prostration, you say, "Allahu Akbar," and you
              assume the sitting position. While in the sitting position you
              pronounce the First Pillar of Submission, the Shahaadah: Ash-Hadu
              Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah.(I bear witness that there is no other
              god beside God.)Wahdahu Laa Shareeka Lah.(He ALONE is God; He has
              no partner.)

              Look to the right and say, "Assalaamu Alaikum," then to the left
              and say the same. This completes the Dawn Prayer.

            <p>
              This prayer consists of 4 units. Thus, you do the first two units
              exactly as explained for the Dawn Prayer up to the sitting
              position. You pronounce the First Pillar (known as "Shahaadah")
              then you stand up for the third unit. You do not utter the Salaams
              (Assalamu Alaikum). <br />
              As you stand up for the third unit you say, "Allahu Akbar." The
              third and fourth units are identical to the first two units.
              <br />
              When you get up from the second prostration of the fourth unit,
              you say "Allahu Akbar" and you assume the sitting position. In the
              sitting position you pronounce the Shahaadah, and you say the
              Salaams on both sides. This concludes the Noon Prayer.

                As noted above, the Dawn, Noon, Afternoon, Sunset and Night
                Prayers consist of 2, 4, 4, 3, & 4 units, respectively. When we
                put these 5 numbers next to each other we get 24434, and this
                number is a multiple of 19 (24434 = 19 x 1286). The common
                denominator of the Quran's code is 19. This phenomenon confirms
                that the number of units for each Contact Prayer has been
                reserved intact, and the sequence 2, 4, 4, 3 and 4 is also
                confirmed.

                utterances must be silent. Anyone may join the group late, in
                the middle of the prayer. He or she must make the same moves as
                the group, then, at the end of the prayer, he or she must stand

              <p className="text-[13px] md:text-[14px] text-center leading-normal">
                The Friday Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jum`ah) is so
                important, a whole sura is entitled "Friday" and a commandment
                is decreed in verse 9 to observe this prayer. Every Submitter -
                man, woman, and child - is commanded by God to observe the
                Friday Congregational Prayer. The Friday Prayer replaces the
                Noon Prayer every Friday. Instead of 4 units, the Friday Prayer
                consists of listening to two sermons delivered by the Imam, and
                two units of prayer. Each sermon must begin with "Al-Hamdu
                Lillah" (Praise be to God), "Laa Elaaha Ella Allah" (No other
                god beside God). Each sermon should last 10-15 minutes and must
                be delivered in the language of the congregation. At the end of
                the first sermon, the congregation is asked to repent, "Tooboo
                Ela Allah." The Imam then sits down for about a minute and makes
                his repentance together with the congregation, then stands up
                for the second sermon. The second sermon ends by asking one of
                the people to say the Azaan. The Imam then leads the 2-unit
                prayer.

                The worshipers may shake hands, hug each other, and/or exchange

                Prayers are a gift from God, that helps us nourish and develop
                our souls. One should be congratulated upon completing such a
